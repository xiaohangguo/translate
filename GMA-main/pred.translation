Repeat on the very American ideal of labour rights
The congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law .
&quot; As trade unions die , the middle class jobs are also dying , &quot; said Ellison , a democrat from Minnesota and vice @-@ chairman of the Progressive Caucus Congress .
Therefore , I am proud to present together with the civil rights victories John Lewis the power of staff .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal means of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops so anti @-@ trade forces .
The addition of national labour law to provide an opportunity for discrimination against workers employed to organise a trade union representation in order to protect justice before a civil court - and to obtain compensation or penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and other sponsors are proposing is to reconcile their legal position to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks that the trade unions have been subjected to over recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans once again encouraged countries to recognise labour rights , expand and comply with labour rights .
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country was democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and association law in an breath .
When the United States was occupied after World War II Japan , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his stab encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that should ensure that militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
In full awareness of the fact that workers and their trade unions play a role in creating a new Japan , they used a language that explicitly recognised that &quot; the rights of workers are guaranteed to unite and joint negotiation and action . &quot;
When the United States came to Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his stab urged Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would be replaced by strong democracy .
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organise themselves , and their voice in the new nation should be raised , Germans added a clause which explicitly said : &apos; The right to establish associations to ensure employment and economic conditions and to improve each individual and every profession or business .
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to narrow it are zero and non @-@ aligned ; these are unlawful measures .
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was appointed the Presidency on the International Human Rights Commission , which was drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that &apos; everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect their interests or join them . &quot;
For generations , Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
When this country was in the process of bringing civil and democratic societies closer together , Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union would then be an equal partner with companies and government bodies - must be protected .
After these rights were brought to an end in America , it was indeed very wise to reconsider the American ideal , which means that the working population must have the right to agree and to speak in a free and open society .
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said five years ago ,
History is a great teacher .
Now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement does not restrict the strength of the nation , but it increased it .
By increasing living standards of millions of people , work has , in a wonderful way , created a market for industry and the entire nation has increased to unpredictable production levels .
Those who are attacking work forget these simple truths , but history keeps them .
History reminds us , and we should do so .
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and enlargement of protection against discrimination against discrimination in the creation of workers &apos; representatives - has long been overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that America has made great in the past and have lost the promise of democracy .
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure
A US Federal judge stopped on Sunday evening the implementation of a law in Louisiana , which lawyers say is likely to end all five abortion clinics of the state .
This measure , which was adopted by Bobby Jindal , Governor of Louisiana , in June on the law and which will enter into force on 1 September , would force doctors who carry out abortion to obtain patient care in a hospital within 30 miles hospital within a radius of 30 miles .
The judge &apos;s decision , however , means that doctors will continue to be able to carry out legal abortion while demanding such a right .
&quot; The plaintiff can continue to work in legal terms , while they are trying to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote Federal judge John deGravelles in his judgment .
Within a month , a hearing will be held for the judge to ensure that the law is a more lasting decision .
The promotion of abortion welcomed the decision to take place recently in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors had more time to gain health care rights .
&quot; Today &apos;s decision means that women in Louisiana are going to leave behind a disproportionate law that wants to protect their health and rights , &quot; said Nancy Northup , President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights , who , on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State , wanted to hold the law .
It was not clear whether the judgment was also based on doctors from the two clinics who did not join the complaint and also requested the right of proof .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in Alabama and Mississippi declared unacceptable .
Key points of a law in Texas , which most of the clinics love in the state have been forced to close , were taken away by a federal judge on Friday .
The promotion of abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that registration rights require unnecessary restrictions on doctors .
The driver is responsible for the fact that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , although some also welcome the effects of closing clinics .
Only a doctor who has been carried out in Louisiana Abtreibungen has patient access to the centre for reproductive rights with .
If all other doctors are forced to do so , no abortion would be allowed to happen , this doctor would no longer be afraid of his safety , said the group .
In their argument against the judgment , representatives of Louisiana said that they were not doctors for carrying out abortion , while their applications for patients &apos; rights were still pending .
If diagnoses and lack of access to best treatments result in higher death rates by emulsion cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have a video record for their mother online , which died in 2007 at Eierstockkrebs .
For women in rural areas of Australia , there is a higher risk of being forced into egg cancer than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1100 Australian people , where Eierstockkrebs were found in 2005 , and found that only 25 % five years after diagnosis was still alive .
The research director Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state who lived mortality risk during the study was 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
KLEINE STUDIE : New medicines could be lung and egg cancer .
Researchers undertook to provide medical care for women over seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis , the type of egg cancer , existing prediseases and social and economic status also affected the survival opportunities .
For older women and those whose cancer has already progressed at the diagnostic point , the excess life rate was the lowest .
For those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk was higher than 20 % during the study in urban areas .
Although the study did not underestimate why women living outside the city are living with higher probability of egg cancer , Dr. Jordan suggests a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors .
&quot; This disease is best used by gynaecological oncologists , and these are mostly found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
Despite improving telemedical services , to prevent the removal somewhat , she proposed that the service should be strengthened by means of assistance from frozen doctors to provide specialists with the opportunity to provide women with their place of residence and treatment programmes for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said that the study should be a bad long @-@ term survival rate for women in EierstockKreab and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
The measures adopted by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer are published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2013 Elisha Neave , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , told her that she had an aggressive form of egg cancer .
Garden centres regret falling house owners
The decline , together with increased declines of the number of homeowners under 35 years , could result in tens of thousands of pounds per year if today &apos;s young consumers lose their lives after a study of HTA , as reported in the Financial Times , the &quot; core age group for garden products . &quot;
The report states that tenants are spending 55 % of the amount that people spend on their own homes for their garden .
The increase in people who live in urban areas without gardens , the popular procedure to park parks for asphalting and the falling garden size are other factors threatening the industry to be implemented in the estimated $ 5 billion per year .
In the Great London area where over a period of 6 years of share of house ownership is reduced from 61 to 43 % , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
HTA and Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants .
Guy Barter , Chief Guy Barter for RHS said : &quot; Containers are for example very popular when renting their plants because they can take their plants into circulation . &quot;
HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of the garden retail trade due to rising domestic ownership figures and economic welfare from the late 1980 &quot; s to the mid @-@ 1990 &quot; s .
He predicted for this year that an improved market situation would also be due to the better weather conditions in March and April last year .
The measures taken by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the spirit Tahirul Qadri are continuing to be pursued in Pakistan .
In the capital of Islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators have killed state television stations PTV .
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers had reintroduced proteins but they could have forced them back from PTV buildings .
The station was founded for about 40 minutes , but it is now sending back .
At the same time around 3000 demonstrators tried to become the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif .
Around a kilometre away from this , they delivered with stables and stones equipped with safety forces .
The police took Tränengas .
The demonstrators called for Sharifs &apos;s resignation , but that is what they are doing .
The army of the country is reminding us of a political solution to the conflict , &quot; without wasting time and applying violence . &quot;
After a meeting at the main quarter on Sunday evening , the military shared with : &quot; The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state . &quot;
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent .
The opposition politician Imran Khan raises Prime Minister Sharif , when he was elected in May last year .
The protests were escalated during the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their supporters to go to Sharifs residence .
In this respect , three people were killed .
Turkey ordered US diplomat for Spionage Reports
Turkey &apos;s Foreign Ministry has awarded the country &apos;s most senior US diplomats to provide accommodation for a report on American and British spy age in Turkey .
It is not possible for ministers of finance to say that the US embassy &apos;s business and Turkish officials discussed this Monday &apos;s report .
The German magazine Der Spiegel und Online magazine The Intercept reported that the US analyst of the National Security Agency , Edward Snowden , showed that Turkey is a major activity area for US and British intelligence services .
According to Turkish news agencies , the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played the importance of the report and said that all major countries were different .
An earlier report that also includes the most important intelligence service in Germany Ankara in the business sector showed a much more severe response from the Turkish Government .
Warning strike : Local leaders are threatening with consequences for Pendler
The German @-@ wide warnings of local leaders on assembly at the end of the assembly could also affect passenger transport in NRW .

We expect significant waste .
Regional priorities are not .
The main thrust of the warnings is freight transport .
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that everything is needed to improve the impact as low as possible .
The GDL did not say where it wanted to strike , however , so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms .
Political leader of Magaluf of Corruption accused
The ankles were present on Friday at the office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvià .
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges by businessmen and barbarians in the notorious Binge @-@ Drinking Hotspot Magaluf .
The main Commissioner , José Antonio Navarro , was appointed to Corrupt before he was accused of several business people from Punta Ballena , the street where most bars and night clubs are located in the area of inquiry .
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario , the ankles gave the office of the Public Prosecutor for Corrupt Control of Majorca on Friday evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvià .
Two other local policemen were killed by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption charges and were arrested by a judge together with Navarro .
National Spanish daily newspaper ABC reported that the poorer night clubs told them that the government &apos;s vetternic economy had serious consequences for their business .
&quot; It is no longer about money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen to the Court .
Let our livelihood come from the game .
We have nothing to lose .
Magaluf made a significant contribution this summer due to a virals YouTube video , where a 18th British tourist was shown to 24 men during a tour Fellatio .
The island authorities have since tried to prevent the illegal behaviour of Algerian holistic tourists in Magaluf by increasing the number of participants in the notorious alcoholic drinks bars .
The Playhouse Club , where the Fellatiovorfall took place , was forced to close for one year while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage jointly imposed a penalty of 55,000 € ( $ 73,000 ) .
The tourist resort Magaluf , which is particularly popular with young British holiday makers , is also known for numerous accidents involving alcohol flow , including the trend of &quot; Balconing &quot; where people move from a balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool .
The first spring day with wet weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
FRÜHLING has developed southern seals a mighty surprise , with strong founders and strong wind that flights from Adelaide airport have been affected .
In the evening until 21 p.m. , another 5mm rain fell to the city , after 6.6mm , which had already fallen on Sunday .
The last fall was the result of a series of short , stormy walls , including a light that began shortly before 20 p.m. and was almost 4mm of decline in about 10 minutes .
After the winter last week for an early dose of spring , temperatures fell again in the city on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8 ° C .
The weather conditions probably have led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide .
The aircraft would have been to land shortly after 19.30 , but was hit by a sherwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start .
Windfalls reached at this time about 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide airport .
The flight data showed that the aircraft was also launched during a second landing flight and finally started at around 20.40 p.m. .
The flight delay resulted in delays in some other flights , including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney .
For Adelaide , on Tuesday , a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted , with possible founders .
Matthies believes that maximum time is needed for large networks
Given the technological progress that has been made in this area , which is our comfortable home in high @-@ tech switches , we are in a position to turn our column Bernd Matthies into an extremely confidential electronic accessory .
While I write here , my view of the spiral box , which links the listener with the phone , and I think : Boah , how retro is that ?
But behind this is a consideration : if the cable were not , all the listeners would be left in the house in a short time , and that would be much more retro .
Ohnhnhnhnlich is on ekeltronic ( ekeltronic ?
No , TippFehler : electronic ) sector the rule that world news today is the electric sink of tomorrow is bought - outdated .
And who , for example , still has a roller TV in the living room today , who says that he simply does not reject television in principle .
Why do these considerations ?
Because we are not convinced that the Ifa is going to press our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics this week .
The laugh that was previously washing machine and CD player blind was not even the purpose of the devices that were equipped with invisible expert prices before him : &quot; Connected Home , Wearables , Health Care and Urban Technologies &quot; promises us the press office .
Yes , &apos; s still ?
What should we talk about with people who seem to be voluntarily extending such Quark ?
In fact , it has been mainly about 20 years ago that we have been able to unite our house .
To make the joghurt look like it is , so that we can get the fire melder in the Maldives holiday , that it is burning in the working room level .
And would it not be wonderful if we were to move from the office to our next arrival ... ?
Yes , this requires air conditioning .
But a dream will be true soon : we will lift our armbanducks , say their &quot; suction ! &quot; - and at home the dust cleaner goes without .
Irre .
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution : &quot; The borders between white and brown goods are being spared &quot; raunt an industry marker , you can connect the washing machine with a headphones that sends the weather report and the data bricks to how long pizza still needs in the backoven , but nothing useful because we are in the stau .
From everyday practice we also know : if a new modified device is really needed , the battery is guaranteed .
What another reason is that the spiral cable is also available on the phone the next radio shows will survive .
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza .
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near Gaza were returned to Gaza on Monday to schools after they had spent summer in air protection rooms , while missile and murderers were on their communities during the 50 @-@ day war between Israel and Hamas , and schools were closed in Gaza , while the area of fighting was recovered .
The school started with rocket inputs , which was named by missile insoles in the south of Israel , and expected , but the signs of the fighting are still fresh .
In the southern town of Ashdod , the staff of the Pashosh family , who was hit by a missile , were killed before the students were brought to Granatsplitter from walls and shells .
&quot; We have a little fear , but are excited , &quot; said Ronit Bart , Anwohnerin Kibutz Saad and there English teacher .
Many children from our region urgently need to return to a routine .
Your 11 @-@ year @-@ old daughter Shani Bart said it feels &quot; a bit comical &quot; to suddenly go back to school .
&quot; These were difficult times , and we have not gone from the house , &quot; she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support .
Until a ceasefire ended last week , thousands of inhabitants of border communities remained under threat , such as Saad in their houses or left their houses to move further away from Gaza and to escape the missile and murderers tax .
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz , a community near the border to Gaza , where a four @-@ year @-@ old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer granate , are still reluctant to return .
The Ministry of Education , with some dozens of families , has not yet returned .
Your children were temporarily housed in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a border city to Gaza , which is difficult to see from the Palestinian strike .
He called on children to learn much and say &apos; we will ensure that their knowledge is employed and offer you security . &quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unconditional freeze on Israel last Tuesday .
The ceasefire was an immediate end to the fighting ; important problems remain unresolved , however , as Hamas &apos;s demand for the lifting of Israel &apos;s Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re @-@ opening of air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel is calling for Hamas to be disarmed and for the transfer of the suffering of two soldiers killed by the Israeli forces .
A new round of indirect talks will probably begin in Egypt this month .
In the war , more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children were killed according to Palestinians and the UN estimates .
Israel is denying this information and estimates that at least half of the beekeepers are fighting , but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
On Israel side 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker were killed .
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza were forced 4.591 missiles and murderers during the fighting against Israeli cities , most of which were in the south of the country .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military has led more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
Israeli attacks were damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and about 250,000 people were killed in more than 100 UN schools that were rebuilt in temporary shelves .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected areas and continue to fight , the education authorities postponed last week &apos;s start to school .
&quot; I hope that school is soon opened again so that we can learn how children in the world and Jewish children , &quot; said Mohammad Amara , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza city .
After choosing Sachsen : CDU @-@ Vize Strobl , NPD @-@ VerbotsVerfahren inquery
Given the loss of votes by NPD in Saxony , CDU Federal Vietnamese Thomas Strobl has voted for an end to the current NPD infringement procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - According to CDU Bundesvize Thomas Strobl , the ongoing prohibition procedure against the NPD should be concluded before the Federal Constitutional Court .
&quot; The NPD is cutting worse than last time , &quot; said Strobl , who also co @-@ chair in Baden @-@ Württemberg is the &quot; Leipzig People &apos;s Time . &quot;
This is a good development in the right direction and a development that I would rather come to the conclusion that the NPD is politically fighting and not before the Constitutional Court .
The NPD was very close to the fifth percent vote on Sunday , and the last five % hurdle failed .
One first round of a ban on the extreme right party was failed in 2003 because constitutional protection was then also in the NPD &apos;s top informants .
In December 2013 , the Federal Council agreed to submit a new request to Karlsruhe .
Federal Government and Bundestag did not come to pass .
Harburg : Tents for new refugees
On the Neuländer Square refugees are now being housed in tents .
The main priority for refugees in Harburg is to place them out of all seals .
Now the Interior Authority has three tents of the Red Cross .
The district politicians were informed of this only shortly before - they are little enthusiastic .
&quot; This skin ruck action continues to raise concerns of citizens and gives the district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humanitarian provision of refugees , &quot; says , Britta Herrmann , group chairman of the Greens in the Harburger district meeting .
Your party calls for the district administration Harburg to be currently using unused houses for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
The reason for overfilling in the first recording is the fall of aid - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient seats in subsequent facilities .
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
The house prices have the strongest winter increase in seven years , shows a widely observed index .
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for own homes in Australia &apos;s capital increased by 1.1 % in August , so the RP data from Monday .
This increase is due to the overall increase in June , July and August at 4.2 % , the biggest increase in winter months since 2007 .
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 % , more than twice the increase in 12 months until August 2013 , but the increases were not distributed equally across the country .
The research manager of RP Data , Tim Lawless , informed that Sydney and Melbourne would drive a two @-@ handed market .
The figures of RP Data show that the house prices were reduced by 16.1 % last year in Sydney , but at least 1 % in Melbourne .
The following markets are Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , where prices are average by five and six percent .
On the other hand , Canberra is located , which is surrounded by the cuts in government spending and where prices are above the year only at 1.4 % .
Mr Lawless said that the early retirement period is now a rise in the price of the real estate to be sold over the next few months , which would undermine the market &apos; to a real test &apos; .
&quot; If you want to reduce the ongoing high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the continuing low interest environment , it is likely that domestic prices will rise in the next three months , &quot; he said .
In an opinion to the new press , he contradicts statements by the head of the head of the company Peer Medau and attacks this , &quot; as a field herr . &quot;
The style of the university is not that , in the communication .
So the Medau family should already be &quot; mid June on the occasion of the arrival of the university .
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is clearly wrong , &quot; says Ping .
At the same time , it points out that there is no question of &apos; setting out &apos; or even &apos; making decisions &apos; , but there are &apos; preferences &apos; .
The Commission &apos;s need for increased mobility of narrow roads to the castle is less dramatic than those of Medaus fear .
From a nine @-@ metre street , and is not the speech .
It is about 5.50 metres , which is a meter wide than it has been , &quot; says Ping .
The argument of Medau operators that their free and debt parking spaces will be available only in future by students of the university , Ping does not want to apply .
The parked is not at all because it is like other public parking places that are now intelligent .
In the Anglo @-@ Saxon
The Kids Crib mountain pasture is located on the ground and is located on the front door to the park deck along the road , according to the university president , it should not be affected .
Instead , it is worth bearing in mind that this is not only about child criticism but also about the inhabitants of the single @-@ oral population to Friedrich strike street and 800 students of neighbouring real school .
It is therefore much more than particultural interests of Mr Medau , so Ping .
Whether criticism of the parental council of child criticism , with the development of the road would be one of the few natural spots Coburgs lost , &quot; can the reader decide . &quot;
At the beginning of October , Ping together with the State Building Office Bamberg will present the city &apos;s dreams of development of the university until 2020 , &quot; and in this context will address the importance of the new development . &quot;
Peer Medau had lost her parents last week with the school &apos;s plans .
Consequently , the entry for the new parking deck should not be as before via the campus and the Friedrich strike street , but via the Medau mountain .
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre length .
According to the high @-@ cost Medaus , transport would be at the Park of Hohenfels by ten times .
From about 2000 vehicles daily , the speech is about .
From the city &apos;s point of view , it was not intended to speak on the project .
Glandorf comes from Handball National Team
Holger Glandorf will no longer be playing for the DHB team .
The 31 @-@ year @-@ old of the Bundesligisten SG Flensburg @-@ Handewitt led to this decision , especially health problems .
The decision is not easy to me , it has been postponed for several months .
It is time for me to draw attention to the signals of my body and to my career in the national team , &quot; said the World Champion of 2007 on his Facebook page .
It is therefore going to be a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 dances for Germany in the international retirement age .
Because the root @-@ huge back space player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg still has a few years to go to Torejagd , he is now facing the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson .
With the Island , which was born on Tuesday to its cader for the country games against Switzerland , Glandorf introduced a &quot; long and good conversation .
His ideas and approaches have been as enthusiastic as they have been for many years and my successors will be enthusiastic .
But for my club I would also like to be available in the next few years , for this reason , longer regenerational courses are needed that do not allow the current double burden .
The left @-@ wing countries had to wait for a Ferseninfection in 2012 .
Due to aillessant problems he had been affected by team physicians of Deutsche Handballbundes ( DHB ) with a cortisonspritze who later had created a strong inflammation .
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed .
Then Glandorf had a complaint against the team archer who ended up with a comparison .
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not go into any body without any hesitation .
I have some health centres that I cannot ignore anymore .
After the three infective footage operations that took place in 2012 , the Commission has recently never correctly identified my blood pressure .
This is where some other disguised complaints are concerned .
Already at the beginning of the year , I noticed that although I do not deceive my head , I do not think my body can deceive , &quot; said Glandorf in the interview to the magazine Handball Time .
For a comeback he would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; If all stricks are tearing , I always have a conversation &quot; said the two @-@ fold family father to the specialist magazine .
However , I cannot support the years when I can still play mobile games , one hand .
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012 I was quite defiant , which concerns my health .
I would like to say at least that I can reasonably go down to my career .
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the winner of Champions League 2014 , he was in 2008 ( HSG Nordhorn ) and 2010 ( TBV Lemgo ) the EHF Pokal .
2012 he also secured with Flensburg the Europapokal of Pocalsiwinner .
German economy in spring by 0.2 % declined
The crises surrounding the globe have caused the German economy to fall into the second quarter .
Gross domestic product fell from April to late June 2014 compared to the pre @-@ quartal by 0.2 % .
The statistics provided by the Federal Office and confirmed provisional calculations .
The consumption alone was the economy in spring , while investment fell .
The external trade also breached the economic economy .
Thanks to the strong annual action , the first half of the year is a GDP plus of 0.8 % compared to the second half of 2013 .
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the Munich monster Moon , which was first introduced by the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday .

The largest cycling association in the Netherlands , NTFU , organized the so @-@ called &quot; Münsterlande @-@ Mooiste . &quot;
This is a major cycling tour across Munich &apos;s Münsterland , the cycling paradise near the Netherlands .
Over 1000 participants were invited to register at Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through Munich &apos;s Münsterland .
The company is written in various specialist magazines , this tour was offered to interested parties .
We come from The Helder and are over night at this round trip .
We want to make the Munich country look closer to this kind of thing , &quot; happy to see cyclists go through the route through the Kreise Steinfurt , Borken and Coesfeld .
After registration in the association of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta .
Katharina went on a small &quot; peace journey &quot; through Wall where the start was also made .
Further , the route that was written for three different categories led to Herrenholz above the Schöppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar .
On routes from 95 km to 1175 altitude meters , 120 km with 1475 altitude metres and 145 km with 1775 altitude meters , cyclists have proven their good condition .
Treatment was carried on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
The main organiser Jos ter Huerne and mayor Heinz Lölfing showed about the success of this cycling event .
We are pleased and it was a great experience for all parties involved .
The organization was without problems and there were no negative incidents , &quot; Heinz Lölfing is taking a positive step towards this event .
Unfortunately , not so many participants were expected to join the organizer , which probably was due to the bad weather forecasts and to the mornings .
&quot; We see ourselves again in 2015 , hopefully , beautiful weather on 30 August or during another weekend , &quot; the cyclists promised to return to Munich again and plan the organizers to reopen .
Constantin Weckers are uncompromising !
It is actually more philosophical evidence than biography , which Konstantin Wecker , Liedermacher , Pacific , politsafe activist , ex @-@ detainees , in &quot; monk and warriors &quot; on 287 pages .
Not chronic but more thought @-@ out networks for thought networks have been born on 1 June 1947 , Munich born its memoirs , each chapter started by a suitable licensing text .
And he is unaware of this : from Onanie as a Gymnasiast to the Ladendiebstahl and Drug Conversion he cannot create human weakness .
Also to show how he himself tolerates tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
Breiten room also take abstract but all the more important terms : love , soul , ego , which His now , spirituality - all he tries to go on for very philosophical but also very personal .
And he also explains his Pacific , his social critique , his political commitment - and also how he has not only shaped music ( the opera owner was born to the soul and rock musician ) , but also his prison stay .
The latter has the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker also added to the asketic monk , which &quot; comes from subtraction &quot; as he says , &quot; by leaving everything unnecessary . &quot;
Between all the highly intellectual views , however , there are short anekdots to earth : for example , through sluts in one of GIs frequented locality or a wrinkling car ride where he looked for a tree .
Since he is also unaware of this .
Lenny Henry : My father never took me into the arm .
Has never said &quot; I love you &quot;
Henry was one of seven children of a family jamaikanian immigrants in Dudley in Midlands in 1958 .
His father who died when Henry 19 was working in a factory and her relationship was limited .
Henry props for a comedy , Rudy &apos;s Rare Records , which partly refers to an imaginary conversation with his father and was born from Radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
But Henry had to be able to work through some difficult childhood moments .
He visited &quot; many &quot; therapies after death of his mother , and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father .
It was difficult to know him .
It never saw his face , heard only his voice : &quot; Hör with the cry .
Lass your sister in peace .
Take a walk !
I want to see Cricket .
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already growing when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things like the form of beerglases or the beauty of a cricket sleep .
I never had such a conversation with him .
Most of my life was he this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper .
Recently , Henry opened a goat in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than at times of his father , he gained an insight into how life was for him .
It is now rather more bright , but they are dark , smoother , deep stylistic labyrinthe with flames and rains and much rest .
My father was simply looking into the bath and then you could hear it slowly how he started to sing because he had been able to wash the goat of himself .
When I went around there , I was told that he had done so for years to prepare food on the table and my respect for him was greater .
Nevertheless , Henry grew up as a child without love .
My father never drove me , he never said &quot; I love you . &quot;
Only when my mother was wrong against the end of her life , we began to say , &quot; I love you , I love you , I love you . &quot;
By its own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he could share the love he had seen as a child .
Could you test with the &quot; I love you &quot; ?
Higher still , to me !
Papa , I am 22 !
with Dawn French .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a great mother .
It is still with French friends who he married 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
Why should we not be friends ?
It is a great mother .
Henrys &apos;s own mother was Diabetikerin .
This contributed to their death .
When I was very much too overweight , and symptomatic of diabetes showed , my doctor said &quot; You must be radical .
So I moved this fitness by and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is hard .
No one likes to eat carrots .
Henrys Karrierewechsel may be shown in his elegant short @-@ cut bart .
Since he was the critic of his Othello , he has been taught by theatre .
It followed the comedy of the irritations , and then Fences of August Wilson .
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and Comedy , which will have completed its business life .
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated and wrote to New Faces about him .
His television career began in mid @-@ 1970s . &quot; I was the only black icon / comedian for a fairly long time on television . &quot;
He learned in profession .
I had to remember not only the public eye , but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how I had an efficient wize @-@ narrative machine could be , while I was a star through television , and that was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager has the right to stage in black and white Minstrel Show , a light entertainment program where people &quot; black @-@ cold , &quot; Henry has led his comedy there over five years .
My family was very unpleasant .
I would like to see it happen never , but I do not want to see it done .
It was a sunny , unpleasant position for me , but I worked on huge projects with and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But this &quot; years of award @-@ winning light pillar of British television &quot; was also a &quot; grotesque parody black man . &quot;
By introducing figures that make British black culture both rife and cooked Henry worked in the Achtzigern an alternative comedykreis .
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to broadcast in 1984 , and in Neunzigern he was among other things the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie Chef !
Advertising , documentaries , TV series and film films will be presented next decade , but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought : &quot; What do you do as the next , Len because it feels like the next , Len , because it &apos;s all that you just feel the time center or trittst a little at the place . &quot;
Then a documentary series for Radio 4 came with the title What &apos;s So Great About ... ?
The first result was three years around Shakespeare .
On Shakespeare , I was quite general .
I had never had a good time at school to know him and thought he was mainly responsible for a domain of middle class , white in Strumpfhosen and a coal head in front .
So I had great fear of it .
Everyone who we have been interested in show interviewte Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said &quot; You should try it once .
Mach it not bad if you do not know what you are doing .
Nimm a few of the words in the mouth , and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare .
Henry introduced 20 lines from Othellos &apos;s last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic .
I had the feeling that I could do so .
It was almost when someone had finally put my head right .
&quot; That is what is at stake , it is a serious matter , it is serious to examine your text , find a little bit .
The samples were brutal , and I read this piece months before we did it .
And it was a success .
They sent an autoaccident and that was simply not .
And soon he came to the comedy of the distortions .
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment when I thought that &apos; Oh , you changed you . &quot;
There was a technical error and Henry felt unstable that he had to talk to the public .
&quot; A small voice told me &quot; You must now overthrow 10 minutes while they repair the computer . &quot;
Instead , the stage leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved .
I went from the stage and anything else in me said &apos; Oh , God was thanks &apos; .
I am not responsible for this .
I can leave that to someone else .
&quot; You play in a theatre piece , so stay in your role . &quot;
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
The text for Fences was ambitious .
Panic is very good , strengthening sight .
The same was true , so it is like a big sign of the gods who tell me &quot; This is your provision . &quot;
He says this , of course , with a DONNER voice .
So I remain here .
I love that .
I love to be in a probenroom .
Henry has always left his head of a Comedian - our conversation is of humorous outbreaks while he always imitates people .
I decided not to have a stand @-@ up comedy because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction would be a room full of strangers somehow dangerous .
If you are looking for the room , you will be going to see a wall .
I sometimes live live in Apollo when I want to do so , but overall there is not so much as before .
I wonder whether he ever wants to have a stand @-@ up comedytour .
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to start a middle part and end a journey - I do not believe I want to give it back .
Is this because it is its new incarnation ?
I think .
I am happy to be an actor .
It &apos;s fun .
You always tell a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
People love stories .
Huthi rebels block roads in Jemens &apos;s capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and Yemenian government , Huthis has led to civilian impunity in the capital of Sanaa .
Huthi supporters would have been central streets in Sanaa on Monday , said a spokesman of Huthi party &quot; Ansar Allah . &quot;
The journey to Parliament has also been blocked .
Jemenitic media report from a traffic schaos in the capital .
According to the online issue of the newspaper &quot; Yemen Post , &quot; Huthi leaders Abdulmalik al @-@ Huthi had called on Sunday evening to take action .
Huthi threatened to provide information about the blatte with another escalation of the conflict , should not meet his demands .
The Shiite Huthis fight for greater independence from Sunni @-@ ruled Yemen and calls for the resignation of the government .
The population of Huthi has been burned for nearly two weeks by the Yemenian capital .
Around 30.000 rebels have been used to protect the large number of refugees from the sea .
In the surrounding country , it is becoming bloody fighting with the Yemenian army .
Kenya registers officials to &quot; intimidate &quot;
Kenya has started to provide all state officials with biometric risky to &quot; hostage workers &quot; from the government &apos;s salaries lists .
Employees who are not registered in the next two weeks will no longer be paid would be paid , a government communication .
The government estimates that thousands of people will also be able to pay for their income after their departure from the public service .
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to take office in 2013 to combat corruption in public service .
In an examination at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( $ 700,000 ) per month was paid for &quot; hostage workers &quot; and other misuse of financial practices .
The government estimates that salaries will continue to be paid out on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service , Wanyama Chebusiri reported for the BBC from Nairobi capital .
All officials must now be involved in identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data is included on biometric registrations , was informed in a government message .
Everyone who does not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the salary list was left out of the communication .
&quot; This approach will make it essential to rationalise public service by increasing the actual number of officials and also reducing the salary list to both levels of government - the &quot; ghost workers , &quot; said Anne Waiguru , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning .

Children need roots and rivers
44 years ago he was in school service , of whom 23 were as a school manager .
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well @-@ established petershauss and collbacher from their time as students .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , but always supported by his desire to see people in the student .
The snow @-@ filled is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home .
Judge was born in Trautenau / Nordböhmen in 1930 , today Trutnov .
Already with 14 interested people he was appointed as head of the school for the teacher profession .
One year later , the Sudetendeutsche enteignet .
Let us have half an hour left the family to leave their house .
After a few months in a camp , it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight waggon .
Thus , judges were forced into the upper @-@ class Senkendorf .
The teacher was born in Bamberg .
To this end , Manfred Richter had to take up six @-@ mile per week to the next station , with the railway to Bamberg going to three kilometres across the city to school and going back to the evening .
After two months Manfred Richter received a rot cross @-@ home home in Bamberg a sleeping thing : together with up to 15 students in a sleeping room .
In 1951 he was the first and 1954 after three years of Lehramtsanwärter &apos;s second state exam .
Since Oberfranken is not free for him , he warn about his first school in Upper Bavaria and came to school on 1 November 1954 .
The &quot; Fräulein room &quot; was his first &quot; service residence in the school house .
In 1958 he was involved in the newly built teaching house next to school a three @-@ room service .
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach 1968 .
Until then , there was a joint joint meeting in Kollbach at the Petershausen @-@ Kollbach school association .
From 1968 / 69 , these were built in Petershausen in today &apos;s Town Hall .
When the school association Indersdorf was founded , only the primary school remained in the place .
To avoid a return to school , which is now smaller , the former director Georg Sigl changed to Charles field - and Manfred Richter was his successor .
But Petershausen grew , and so children and their teachers could take up today &apos;s construction from September 1982 , which was extended to Richters Pensioning in 1997 .
Manfred Richter loves the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz , who added a workshop and a room for improvement in 1997 , even though the school buildings directives were not capable of being implemented .
&quot; Mayor Götz was very guilty , &quot; reminded judge .
In his career Manfred Richter never made the speech of a government representative who was on a meeting of a school council on justice and justice : &apos; You must never forget love &apos; ; Manfred Richter set out what he had heard as a young teacher .
&quot; You must give children two standards : roots and rivers , &quot; says the 84 @-@ year @-@ old .
And he had to know : &quot; This is not always possible . &quot; Whether he only manages his students or just his own six children is not quite clear .
In any case , Richters Tun was sometimes unconventional .
If students are checked , they did not complain about him or she was not forced to sit down .
At the expense of the community , judges had to create two pair of boxing shoes and left two contrasts against each other , even if there was a veil .
For the good of school , judges served as a record director of the then mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
This moving party judge after his retirement was sentenced to at least as the last one on CSU list for the Community in 1996 .
But judges were elected on place six and joined CSU .
180 km in three days
HR4 @-@ RADTOUR 700 cyclists set up in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten Zwischenenstopps
If cyclists are on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast , this is not something special .
On Friday , however , the number of rounds alone made the impression : the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in Schottener Alteburgpark .
Under the motto &quot; cycling and celebrate new paths between Nidda and Kinzig , &quot; participants on Thursday in Bad Vilbel met and there was a concert by Van Baker &amp; Band .
On Friday it was taken seriously : the cyclists took the first stage , which took 60 kilometres over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further after Scots .
In Bad Salzhausen , sports enthusiasts were invited by Mayor Hans @-@ Peter Seum , who was in Bad Vilbel with bicycle , and the head of the Bad Salzhausen company , Petra Schwing @-@ Döring , welcomed .
To refreshment body and mind was very well prepared : the land women from Ranstadt and Nieder Mockstadt had 85 Bleche Apfel- , TChechen , Streusel- and Käsekuchen who had been wonderful cyclists .
&quot; Such cakes can only be found in rural women backs , &quot; praised a participant from Aulendiebach , while he was another piece of ordained .
On the Getränkestand of the Turnvereins Geiß @-@ Nidda , cold refreshments could be found .
The Duo Bravo was the first to offer visitors with well @-@ known melodies from operets and music and to be proud of appearances .
The beautiful setting of the park was relaxing .
A Lord was also a headmassage of his partner : &quot; He deserves it , after all he has already saved bicycle chains back today . &quot;
This was because the mayor and the manager had to work : they were at the fountain before the drinking curve of Reporters Rainer Janke interviewt and used the opportunity to advertise in radio for Bad Salzhausen .
Promotionhead Tobias Hagen , who has been working since the first hr4 @-@ cycle tour 2004 , has been able to quickly get off , he had plenty of experience with technology on site .
His pioneup truck , where he was able to use three phones and a radio device with his staff and the 15 @-@ head motor bike staffs of the police Hessen , wrote Facebook entries and made reportage , also needed a check .
&quot; Most of the participants come from the Rhine @-@ Main area , &quot; he told , &quot; but also from Guss or Fulda , Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many cities in Western fales , cyclists were encouraged .
The number of participants is a little more than the available accommodation capacity .
In category I , participants will be accommodated in hotels , category II in collection accommodation .
From the resort , cyclists had a good impression when they were reopened after one and a half hours : &quot; Cherüss ! &quot;
&quot; It was nice in Bad Salzhausen ! &quot; she went to the difference .
After arrival in Schotten , the group had to take a short break .
But in the evening , cyclists were in the idyllic Alteburgpark .
Under the control of the Schottener Society for Tourism and City Marketing ( GTS ) , the park had a beautiful festivities and of course it had been possible to have a few taverns with well @-@ cooled spring white .
Civil championship Susanne Schaab , GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner @-@ Sachs in his role as Executive Board member of ADAC Hessen @-@ Thüringen welcomed visitors .
The three clearly welcomed the &quot; many operations in Scots . &quot;
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dance stage free .
The opportunity to swallow under free sky was not even possible despite the sporting activity on the bike .
Under the guests of mixed citizens who are increasingly affected by the good mood as well as the great char of cyclists .
On the second day , the Birstein cyclists were the stations , Wäch@-@ bach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - on the programme .
Yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycle elves , the sports enthusiasts met again in Bad Vilbel .
Dozens of Turkish police officers for &quot; disruption &quot; against the government have been arrested
In total 33 police officers were killed in Turkey because of the suspicion of &quot; disruption to the government &quot; ; local media agencies are reporting .
The police authorities did not make a direct comment .
Under arrest , 14 senior police officers , Hürriyet Daily News .
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government workers , including four government ministers last December .
In July a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly established an organised criminal association and telephone numbers were set up .
Turkey &apos;s President Recep Tayip Erdogan ( who then Prime Minister ) described her approach as part of the activities carried out by Islamic ghost Fethulla Valid against him and other people in power positions .
Not all children in Ukraine return to school .
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday ( 1 September ) after summer holidays .
This day is traditionally an important day for families , and thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk to school .
There he told journalists that not all schools had opened again , but he was determined to defend the country for future generations :
September &apos;s celebrations were not held in every school .
The sky is not peaceful everywhere about Ukraine .
We must fight for a peaceful sky .
The whole Ukraine , a huge joint Ukrainian People &apos;s Front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Aleksan Pastukhow , school manager of Slawjansk school , who was visiting Jazenjuks daughter , spoke to Russian .
We hope that peace will finally be restored and that children will receive education that will be useful to them in their lives .
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children being embroiled shirts , balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers .
With Rona Fairhead , the BBC may have found the great director you need .
It is true with a proud fame trap from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the Tory party .
And she has his own frontier experience .
Your career began with the worldwide management consultancy Bain and Co . , which she was appointed to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the media world of Pearsons .
It was seven years of managing director of Financial Times and came back when the top post of the parent company Pearson came to a younger male colleague .
Your invention was supposed to have been almost $ 1 million .
Their political ranking is also solid .
It was founded by Lord Browser , the former chairman of BP , who recommended that he should be treated as a private knowledge in Whitehall : she was born to the Beraterin des Kabinett .
Your husband is an early Tory Council member .
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned Kelch .
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
The confidence is in two directions : to the inside on the first yarn of the own managementhierarchy in the BBC , but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong .
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol that requires full reform .
But what new president would risk starting to go to everything and to take an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while he may be doing his job .
It is a difficult task .
And as if that were not enough , many people are interested in reducing the BBC - power , money and status .
While competition is closer and new technologies are threatening old , comfortable security , the forthcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is linked to special risks .
For the modest sum of EUR 145.50 per year , the British public is buying in the world &apos;s largest media company .
The BBC tells you a good story : it says that it reaches 96 % of all households and costs only 40 pence per day .
And apparently the BBC is growing on the popularity scale : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % before 10 years ago .
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed : I am now receiving news news lines on my mobile phone and see adapted programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very popular and significant institution .
It needs a significant chairman - I hope she has found it .
Perry from Texas says that the depleting Tweet was not authorized
A Tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas , Rick Perry , published a statement on Sunday about democratic district districts that are at the heart of a criminal charge against him because of abuse of the authority .
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another perrys user account that was the previous one .
It is precisely a task of my account that has been sent out from my account , which was not authorized by me .
&quot; I approve of the Tweet and have deleted it , &quot; it said in the later news .
Employees from Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
Although the Tweets of Perrys were official user account , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
In the previous Tweet , an unfavourable picture of the district &apos;s public forest was taken by Travis County , Rosemary Lehmberg , who was named for Trunkenheit at the tax in April 2013 .
Perry put a veto against a financial support of her office when she refused to return , which led to an accusation against Perry - which might be 2016 presidential candidate - this month in Austin .
The text of the table is : &apos; I do not always have been drunk with the three times permitted alcohol levels ... but if I do , I will be able to complain Governor Perry when he spreads it . &quot;
I am the most perplexed democracy in Texas .
Let &apos;s say that the office was not with the leadership over the study of the Grand Jury against Perry .
This was created by Michael McCrum , a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was elected by a Republican judge .
Perry calls for not guilty and called for a political trick .
His highly clamorous team of legal councils asked for the case of the judge who was accused of exposing and arguing that the law , with which he was the most senior governor in the history of Texas , was undecided .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million of public money from the State Integrty Unit - which is located in Travis County and is in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to return .
This veto was a public complaint by a left @-@ wing Watchdog group .
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous .
After he was elected to the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential term in 2012 , Perry went to speculations that he would stop by ending a tweet of a photo of himself at the jogging near a lake poet , with the words &quot; South Carolina , we come ! &quot;
Berkeley explains housing market again for &quot; normal &quot;
One of the most prominent construction companies in London was that the housing market in South America was once again a standard &quot; return &quot; to normal levels .
Self @-@ healing in the capital was a very popular subject and was the subject of huge price increases , which the Bank of England was so keen to see in June because of the widespread fear of a credit bubble .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of the highly classical construction company Berkeley said at Monday : &quot; Since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has been back to normal transaction levels since the end of 2013 , &quot; and added that this is a &quot; stable handling environment . &quot;
The real estate market in London was well placed during the downturn , because foreign buyers urged the capital .
According to information from the catasteramt , prices in the city area have fallen by 18,5 % over the past year alone , far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
The average sales price for Berkeleys private , low @-@ cost and student offers increased by about one fifth in the past year and was at the end of April at € 423.000 .
A stronger pound has , however , lost real estate property in London over recent months - some of them have been also affected by the introduction of new property companies and political rhetoric to allow for a possible &quot; housing tax &quot; before the general elections in May .
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that mortgage market report for April , which proposed tougher credit regulations , was also reduced to less market growth in the second half of the year , both in the real estate sale and prices .
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July , which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling .
Hamptions International , another real estate agency , corrected its prediction for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 to below 3 % , based on an already weakened skin price awareness .
The transaction volume in London &apos;s most expensive areas , such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington , has now fallen by one quarter for year , so the Makler WA Ellis .
Nevertheless , the desire for an own home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing , since the accidental amounts for derivatives are more than € 2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : &apos; demand for the right product to be well planned at the best locations remained stable and as a result , the sales of the deadlines remain stable . &apos;
In June , the company reported that it had 3.742 new homes in the year until end of April - almost one third more than in 2007 before the crisis .
The annual tax result increased by 40 % annually to 280 million € , sales by 18 % to € 1.6 billion .
In a communication on Monday before the Annual Meeting of the Company , Mr Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley will probably correspond to the current market expectations in the current year .
Analysts agree that annual tax results are estimated at £ 450 million .
Berkeley shares were in London &apos;s trade in the afternoon at € 23.96 .
Nacktfotos by Jennifer Lawrence by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscarverleihung .
Nacktfotos of the Oscarpreisträerin Jennifer Lawrence have been published online by a hacker who claimed that a &quot; master list &quot; of images of another 100 Starlets have been published online .
A representative of the stars from &quot; The Tribute of Panem &quot; confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were true and accused the hacker for &quot; eclatant violation of privacy . &quot;
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who have taken the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence .
The photos originally on the photo sharing page 4chan were printed on the photo page were allegedly replaced by a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple , which means that the alleged &quot; master list &quot; of hingoppers includes the names of dozens of female stars , including Rihanna , Kim Kardashian , Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary @-@ Kate Olsen , reported BuzzFeed .
It is not certain how many of the images are true , although Winstead , Star from &quot; Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; also condemned the hack .
&quot; On those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken part in our private environment for years - I hope you are so satisfied with you , &quot; wrote Winstead on Twitter .
Victoria Justice from Nickolodeonserien &quot; iCarly &quot; and &quot; Victorious &quot; stritt however , that it is about images of her handele and tweetete &quot; These so @-@ called naked images of me are GEFÄLSCHT , people .
Do we want to see the beginning right now ? * What &apos;s the intention ?
Buzzfeed reported at the late Sunday that a spokesman of Popstars Ariana Grande had the authenticity of the supposed photos of her .
Exclusive extraction from Howard Jacobsons high @-@ yellow new novel about love and letter &quot; J . &quot;
They were closed , so you could describe it best , slowly turned into a carton that you have in the rain .
Occasionally , he said to him that he was too serious , tough , tough , intense , distance and perhaps something more kratzbürstig .
And shake him then hand .
Kratzbürstig knew him .
He was stacheful , as in Igel , yes .
The last victim of this stachelity was a very early affair that was promising for a alleviation of the lonely lungs of his life as otherwise , and perhaps even a certain satisfaction .
Ailinn Solomons was a delicate beauty with unheard hair and a flatterness heart from a village on the north island , which was even more remote and smoother than Port Reuben .
It was equipped with an older support to the south , which Kevern had for her tante , and which had a plot in a feud but paradic valley with the true name Paradise Valley .
Over several years nobody had lived in the house .
The pipes were empty , in the bathrooms were still spinning , naked pads had left their traces on all windows and believed that they were all , and the garden was with unbridled , which saw as huge coal heads .
It was like the house from a child &apos;s mourning , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel &quot; J &quot; was born in London for the man Booker Prize 2014 .
Shortlist will be announced next week .
Kevern had been in contact with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and an unusual warm early afternoon enjoyed both horny and cold .
Your feet are too big .
Due to their uraculous aggression , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
Not banned - nothing was quite right - simply not played .
It was successfully obsolesced , as the word obsolescent .
The general taste created what Erlasse and rules never had , and how people could have done the things from books to the millionaire memoiren , cooking books and love romantic , they chose to choose from music the balloons .
In the euphoria of the day Kevern started an imaginary piano and was born in a large @-@ comic Serenade Ailinns great feet .
Ailinn was not .
&quot; This was a famous song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller , &quot; he explained her and put two fingers to his lips automatically .
That had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came from his mouth .
It had been a game between him and his father when he was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , he told .
If you have a word with an J initially , without two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
It was not a very funny game at that time , and it was not very funny now .
He knew he expected this from him , that was all .
It was necessary to explain what jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard what .
Jazz was also played , even if it was not directly forbidden .
Improvisional was no longer modern .
It was only space for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
People wanted to start a melody quite safely where they would end .
Similarly , the mind .
His unpredictable attitude made people nervous .
And jazz was musical @-@ oppressed mind .
Although he was 10 years old , without being from Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about jazz from half secret collection of old CDs of his father .
But at least he had to say that Fats Waller was black .
In her age she probably could not remember a time when Popsänger was not black .
Once again , no laws or constraints were applied .
A conformed society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group concept - thank you like the fate of the fate .
People with afro @-@ Caribbean origin were affected by temperament and body construction for entertainment and sport , i.e. gentle and ranked them .
People who originally came from India &apos;s subcontinent were like nature with electronic talent and were with the task of ensuring that no family without working telephone was left .
What is left of the Polish community is that the question of the canalisation was left ; what was left by the Greeks was a bolder .
Those who are from the Gulf States and levels whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WAS GESCHEHEN WAR , WENN ES GESCHEHEN WAR , are afraid of being accused of being even being slaughtered from fear that flames would consume them as next - had labneh- and Shisha arrows restaurants opened up , thought and were depressed with inaction .
Any one according to his abilities .
Since they only had to download Balladen , Ailinn was hard to understand how the fuelling words that Kevern had just expressed could be the one that could be .
Music was an expression of love .
&quot; These are not really offensive , &quot; said Kevern .
Apart from perhaps for people whose feet are too large .
My father never accused anyone , but he loved this song .
He was too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security .
Nothing could be done to reduce the huge carbon bubbles .
Ailinn was still not there .
Why would your father have love so much ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , but hesitated to return two fingers to the lips in their present presence .
She thought that he was somewhat sunny .
&quot; It seemed funny to him , &quot; he said instead .
They shaken unbelievable their heads and blocked Keverns &apos;s view .
There was nothing else to see throughout the world about their unbridled black hair .
There was nothing that he would otherwise have liked to see .
&quot; If you say it , &quot; my them without conviction .
But this does not explain why you prefer me .
It seemed to be honest .
Are my feet too big ?
He saw again .
Your feet are not as direct as they are .
Perhaps your buttons , a little bit ...
And you say you hath hath me because my buttons are too thick ?
You hate ?
Of course I don &apos;t hate you .
This is only the stupid song .
He could have said , &apos; I love you &apos; , but it was too early .
&quot; Your thick buttons are exactly why you are forgetting me , &quot; he tried it instead .
I am a little perverse .
The sound is not right .
It was comical .
If he tried to be comical , he often brought into difficulties because he did not like his father &apos;s reassuring charm that he needed to make the intractive cruelty that was intractable in jails .
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he wanted to use Kevern , who he .
Despite his friendly eyes .
Ailinn Solomons was born in red and raised from her sun chair , waiting the console for and shaken the wine she had drunk .
Holunderblüte wine , so Trunkenheit was not an excuse for him .
In its creation , it seemed to be too angry as Palmwedel was in storm .
&quot; And your dickhead is exactly why I am perverse to you to feel &quot; she said ...
Apart from that , I am not at all .
She did not regret him because of the unease of his words and fear that has shown himself in her eyes as they opposed him .
Dachte they propose that they would be ?
She had not been able to live on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here .
The same huge and ice @-@ cold ocean collapsed here as there on the shore .
The same confused men , with even more thick skin and dickering after DEM WAS GESCHEHEN WAR than they were their ancestors as jewellers and beach atrocities , were always prepared to raise the hand against a woman who refused or moved .
Dickkopf ?
That would have been a thick fist if they were not adapted !
You will only be short - Knutschen was the most used word for erotic attraction between men and women , a countergift to non @-@ seasonal love balloons from the console - they will only scarce and then beat .
After Keverns &apos;s view , this was an unnecessary constitutional one , since Knutschen himself already presented an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body .
He was born from the sun chair like an old man .
They also felt they were standing , but the desire of his graves surprised them .
That was not the end of the world .
You knew nothing about it .
She saw him as he was away - as he was from a room on the upper floor her companion told him - a man complained by something he himself had done .
Adam leaves the garden , thought it .
They felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some of their hands had raised against them .
A man changed from her back , his back exploited , defeated , defeated , without fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well if she could not remember a single time before today &apos;s day ?
When they were alone , Ailinn Solomons looked back on their feet .
Some years before the recent events , Esme Nussbaum worked together , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32 @-@ year research teacher on behalf of Ofnow , the non @-@ legislative monitoring body for public mood , a short talk about continued violence at low and medium @-@ sized levels in exactly the countries where their reduction , if not abolition , was expected , was most likely to be expected , given the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence .
&quot; It has already been done a lot , and much still needs to be done , &quot; wrote it , &quot; to promote the supposed aggression of a people who have led thousands of wars and who have won most of them , especially in remote corners and valleys of the country where the southern breath of human friendliness has historically been seen despite the high rise of cherries between the hedges .
But some characteristics are unthinkable .
The higher the church tower , it seems , the less the passion it continues to inspire .
The population is waging at hearing sentimental balloons , deprives itself of stories about excessive difficulties and claims that the virtues of Heirat and family life are firmly believed , but not only does the previous cruelty keep rural communities as well as our urban fabric , but there are evidence of the emergence of a new and disproportionate dispute at home , at work , on roads and even on the fields of play .
&quot; You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , &quot; she said her mentor , when he read the whole report .
I propose that you read less Romans .
Esme Nussbaum sensed her head .
I must also ask : are you athlete ?
&quot; I do not think that this must be said , &quot; said Esme Nussbaum .
Are you reading ?
Once again , Esme has been focusing on her right to privacy and refusal to say so .
Feministin ?
Once again .
&quot; I do not ask , &quot; said Luther Rabinowitz finally , &quot; because I voted against atheism , readiness or feminism .
The one thing that is here is a predominant job .
We serve a pre @-@ partial society .
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and commendable are sometimes results , as you have presented them .
You yourself have clearly made prejudices against the church , and these things you call &apos; disguise &apos; and &apos; roh &apos; could be as good as expression of a natural force and vitality .
If you continue to go on the round , WAS GESCHEHEN IST , WENN ES GESCHEHEN IST , as if it were done yesterday , it means giving the country its essential vitality .
Esme Nussbaum saw around , while Rabinowitz spoke .
Behind his head repeated an LED writing in Flamingorosa the advice that Ofnow gave to the country last quarter of a hundred or longer period .
Lächeln Sie ihre Nachbarn an , wertschätze Sie ihre Partner , hören Balladen , besuchen Musicals , nutzen ihr Telefon , sprechen Sie , reden Sie hören zu , erklären Sie zu , hören Sie sich , hören zu stimmen , entschuldigen sich .
Talk is better than silence , the healthy word is better than the written but nothing is better than love .
&quot; I fully understand what you want to do , &quot; Esme Nussbaum answered with a quiet voice than she was sure that her predecessor had spoken at the end , &quot; and I say nothing else than that we are not yet so effective as we ourselves do .
My concern is that without warning we may be able to find ourselves in the way we repeat the mistakes that have been made ever before DEM WAS GESCHEHEN IST , WENN ES GESCHEHEN IST .
This time , however , it is not the other people we are going to be doing our anger and mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands .
To avoid this , we need to show an engelsgeduld .
&quot; You go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if you call actions as &quot; errors &quot; that might be our grandparents or not .
They also go too far if you talk about the fact that they are &quot; anger &quot; and their &quot; mistrust &quot; to others .
It should not be necessary to give someone in your position to remember that , in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , we are not talking about &quot; us &quot; and &quot; others . &quot;
There was no &apos; we &apos; and there was no &apos; other &apos; .
It was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
&quot; From what we are honest about ourselves , &quot; Esme dared to take up , &quot; no part of society can claim to have a good attitude .
I am not a Member of this House .
Whether it was bad or good , what happened is happening .
That was then .
To this end , nothing more needs to be said - because we agree .
And just as no fault must be given , no fault must be given if such a eradication were appropriate and if there were a way to eradicate it .
But what is the purpose of the past if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to forget them .
If I may say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz left his pyramid together .
&quot; I will take note of her report , &quot; he said and left her out .
The next day , when they were used to work , they were overtaken by a motorcyclist who , as passants described , was in a kind of &quot; brutal rage &quot; on foot .
In cases there are .
Lesotho military member says that no coup was planned ; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho dispute to overthrow the government &apos;s government and said that they were against policemen who accused the armed forces of political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane flew from the country and shared with the army of the country &apos;s office and government building in the capital Maseru .
The Premier brought his family into neighbouring South Africa after he reported from attacks .
Military speaking Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no real state dispute , but that the military is on the threat of &quot; political fanatics , &quot; whose armed forces were to be opened up by the police .
&quot; What happened this morning was that the state of defense forces operated by Lesotho , after having received several secret services reports that actually act some elements that actually armed some of the political , party political young fanatics who wanted to do some of the political , party political young fanatics who were just before doing devastating damage , &quot; he said to Voice of America .
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action has made the impression of a crash .
&quot; Even if no one has claimed that the government has been torn down by violence , all reports agree that the activities of defense forces have been marked by Lesotho &apos;s actions so far as signs of a coup are concerned , &quot; he said .
Speaker of the military of Lesotho shared on Sunday that soldiers were reluctant to return to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm .
In the meantime , the smier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over government leadership during Thabanes &apos;s absence .
Thabane told that he believed he was wrong because of his desire to combat corruption in the country .
In Lesotho there have been major tensions since June , after Thabane &apos;s parliamentary meetings were held in his single government .
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government , otherwise laudable accusations of the matter .
Production in the eurozone at a 13 month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed down in August to the lowest point of last 13 months , so a carefully monitored study .
The final market index of the production index of the manufacturing industry ( PMI ) fell to 50,7 in August , after a booth of 51.8 in July .
A figure of 50 gives an expansion .
New orders went back and factories experienced breakthroughs in a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The figures are meeting before the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday .
Markets expect a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery of the eurozone and for the threat of deflation in an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
There are speculation that the ECB &apos;s head , Mario Draghi , will make further information during this week , whether he considers quantitative relief for the eurozone , according to those who have been made by Britain and the US during the financial crisis .
&quot; Although a small growth is better than no growth , the braking effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty have become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; Rob Dobson said , leading economists in market it .
The factory PMI for Germany , the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
In the meantime , the second largest economic nation of the bloc , France , the PMI fell to 46.9 .
France remains a kind of species , as well as the withdrawal of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation .
Note that growth incentives in key industries are Germany and Spain and the Netherlands , and the Netherlands are no longer reassuring , &quot; said Mr Dobson .
The decline in industry probably fueled fire of analysts who would expect further monetary or fiscal incentives .
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland where the PMI increased to 57.3 , the highest level since late 1999 .
Howard Picard , chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight , said : &quot; The best thing you need for the shopping management index of the manufacturing industry in the eurozone from August is that after that , the sector will continue to grow . &quot;
He added : &quot; Producers in the eurozone find life obviously quite difficult at present , because current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are increasingly difficult to grow in many countries .
This increased uncertainty has clearly affected the economy - particularly consumers - and it is likely that some orders are delayed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
He said that it is &quot; becoming increasingly likely &quot; that the ECB will eventually have to launch a kind of QE , &quot; although we suspect that this will be limited . &quot;
The Höllenjahrjahrnten der Überleben von Beslan : Ten years have been the terrible insult of school , as the children who have been killed there are still suffering today .
Ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were killed by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Spain than hostage .
More than 330 people , more than half of them were killed in the three @-@ day martyrium that the world shocked .
We are back to Beslan to see some of the victims who are victims of death in the Greueltat class room .
That is exactly a decade after the appalling recovery of the school of Beslan , where 334 people came around , including 186 children , warned the helmful survivors of past night before a new pharmacist in Ukraine .
As a fanatic Islamist terrorist , children and parents on 1 September 2004 , began a new school year , caught and killed , seemed like the evil evil &apos;s evil &apos;s evil .
The tragedy united West and East in Abeu , and then surprised in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to see some of the victims who were victims of death in the Greueltat class room .
We were surprised by young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of these terrorist hell will always follow them .
Their greatest hope ?
That the war that Ukraine is now experiencing - and in children like them die - is now going to end .
The girl who photographed during the attempt to get into the shallow school sports hall will be the girl who will be taking part .
It was created by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she tried only to be in her underwear to return to the disguised school sports scene after a mine exploded .
It is a very confusing Aida after her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
Both were held dead , but they survived .
&quot; A woman told me I should go around my life , but I could not say &quot; said Aida then .
My legs were bluttered .
I was on and climbing again to my mother .
A soldier brought them into safety .
After a number of operations , she thought she was completely secret , but said yesterday : &quot; Three months ago , the pain returned .
I fear that I must be reactive .
Some granatsplitter are still in my knee .
Their aim is to provide dental medical care to help people , as their doctors have helped .
&quot; This tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says it was fighting fluid .
&quot; This happened to me , and that cannot be changed .
Once in year I always go into sports halls to remember who remained there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future class kameradin Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together when we were small and dreamed of it together to go to school .
&quot; I do not want to cure until I have completed my studies and my career .
At a family I think later .
It says that the recovery always remains part of it , although the memory of every year is somewhat more weak .
I am pleased that many people in the world are still reminded of our horrors and we are grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and throughout .
If I want to see the photo of me online , how I can see back into school , I think that many people see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help to ensure that something does not happen again .
The boy who was killed by the ball fire , in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first school day ( Russians go to school for 7 years ) and survived the three @-@ day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara .
As seven years ago he said : &apos; Mama told me that I should be looking at an explosion and her hand . &quot;
After an explosion he thought she would die .
She said to him : &quot; Run . &quot;
Voller fear that they can be dead , floh and saw on the way a tiny little , it took the hand and floh through a ball .
His father Vladimir , who left his son outside into the arms , said : &quot; Damir told me that his mother was died .
He said : &apos; I could not save them . &quot;
In reality Tamara was out there and was wounded with beincers in hospital , in turn in accepting that her son had come .
After reunification , she said : &quot; I was happy .
I could not believe it .
He was at the beginning and drowned me .
Damir was later arrested to London ( from the now released newspaper News of the World ) to be released by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of a Barnardo &apos;s Children &apos;s Champion .
&quot; This horror follows you every day , but I wish I could stop thinking with the memory , &quot; he said yesterday .
But I can say that it is blessed in my memory .
I still know that I have to use my games pistols directly afterwards .
But now I can play computer games with shutters and that is not a problem for me .
&quot; I have no fear of being back into the sports halls , but I do not think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I played in the Court , and who did not manage to go outside .
We never say that they were killed or dead .
We say that they are still in sport .
I remember very well my journey to London , especially to the games shop where I could find everything I wanted and the journey in a top open car .
But now he fears about place like Ukraine , where wars are causing the kind of disaster he and his friends suffered .
This horror follows you every day , but I wish I could stop reminding myself of it .
&quot; It is my shame to all those who are suffering from the Greueln , &quot; said Damir , who was last week as a volunteer in a monastery .
I would like to help .
I want to go to police one day and hope that they will be able to take me to the school school next year .
His mother Tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , you can imagine that ?
I remember the terrible silence following the siege , there were simply no children who could call and walk around , and this silence lasted many months .
It reminds you of their journey to London with Damir .
People in London were afraid when I told our story .
I was then , as people on the other side of the world understood our feelings and supported them .
It was Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and say her own , that 10 years have passed , but I still remember her and her husband in London , and how Damir and me helped .
I remember how Damir would like to eat Borschtsch and put them all local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he was working with cellors in a restaurant , and Damir was shocked with his water pistole on her and she went away and played with him .
And that was just one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British were so willing to express our pain and supported us .
She said : &apos; I always think that this world is not better over these 10 years .
In Ukraine , war is now continuing , and every day people die , and I believe that many children have been killed and killed .
These are precisely such children as ours .
I think that for many of the war , part of the news is that they hear when they came or deal with something else .
I simply know what these people feel , the whole horror .
And I cannot stop feeling that .
Nothing has changed , people want to always kill each other and that is so sad .
Damir was a great and quiet boy , he was not aggressive or angry at all .
He is not looking for rache , he is not overshadowed by the last Greueln .
I know that he does not like to remember this , but he has six close friends from the class and she sometimes go to the sports halls and they are angry there candles .
When he was small , he suffered - I remember how he sometimes looked at the sofa , the face of us turned off , hours .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I remember how he was all his weapons and other military toys , and Damir is now 17 , larger than I , good @-@ looking , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for some hours that he was dead and I never saw him again .
When I was looking for an explosion , I was looking back to the legs , and saw the hell around me , with all over the body parts .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy would not have survived in this hell .
&quot; I remember that I called him to &quot; Damir , run away , &quot; but I was so sure he did not hear me .
But he has heard and he has gone away .
And so life , unlike many others , goes for us .
Georgij Ilyin , 17
The boy whose terrible image after the recovery to the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Trost : The Beslan survivors of Georgij Lyin , with his mother Fatima after the 2004 Belagation , are an image of Georgij today
His bloodstream face was marked by fear when he was ranked around his life while Chechen terrorists were shattering his class cabins .
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan .
His mother Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had him for his first day before she was left to leave her older son Vladimir to university .
&quot; I left the Court about two minutes before terrorists crashed him , and so my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she recalls himself .
Not only because it was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
Only my Georgij managed to survive .
The closer this date is , the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it .
There is no single day when we are not reminded of this tragedy .
We do not think it is long ago , I think it would be done yesterday , some scenes from these days follow me forever .
No one will forget that ever I promise you .
It is urgent that the image of Georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of attack and was considered a statue ( right ) .
I remember that Georgij was happy to go to school this day , saying he wanted to repay his teacher .
I knew only that he was alive when I saw him on television .
And now there is even this statue of the Georgij in San Marino .
Georgij sees the picture not like it , and it is at home in the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also think that people in all over the world feel that thanks to this picture , they feel our pain .
Georgij says today : &apos; It is important to never again do so .
&quot; I doubt that we have ever seen the truth .
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never knowing the truth .
And now they are investigating the fall of this Boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused him ?
This world will become a terrible thing .
&quot; I cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants to war , so how does that happen ?
Ten years have nothing to do with such pain .
We need dozens of years to make it a little forgotten .
It has attacked my health and I feel it still .
About three or four years ago I had a few albumen because of the siege , but then it was better .
I went back to school in 2004 and I had every day fear .
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed .
That is why I always go into sports centres when 1 September is closer .
I want to express my old childhood friends Tribut .
It is difficult for me to go into sports halls , but I must do so .
I do not feel as a victim , this history is now part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I am not involved .
My life goes on .
I have completed this year &apos;s school and visited a medical university in Wladikawkaz .
I will be very grateful .
My first choice was training in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgij Fanijew , 20
The boy who lived beyond , although he was on foot of a murderous terrorist
A miracle : Georgij Fanijew was at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege , but he managed to survive .
During the siege he was in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb that was on foot a murderous terrorist .
It is really a wonder that he was not killed .
&quot; We feel it was when it was yesterday that &apos; says Georgij , who was appointed as a secret service officer to FSB , but this was not possible because of his health damage .
It is still my case that there is nothing I left behind .
I am now older and people say that children are easily able to deal with bad experiences - I must say that is not true .
&quot; 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt better then , but I cannot forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - In 2005 - was the first and only time I was again in the sports halls .
I lost awareness .
I will never return there again and ask me not to show you where I have been healthy in this famous picture .
Surprisingly : Georgij Fanijew today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on Laptop
My pain is immense and I wear it every day with me .
My friends know that I do not like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me after school .
Boasting me is good .
I should be careful to be with my last knever , but I can now go well .
But because of my health I could not be involved in the FSB &apos;s secret service college in Sankt Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have my documents , including medical ones , and I have replied that it is not possible .
My second passion was the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have already spent two years behind me .
He learns about the treatment of all animals from cats to cows .
He said : &quot; I knew that I never told my children about my experiences .
We should not know about children and they should not , of course , suffer it .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : &quot; This pain leaves me never .
He is in my soul , worse if the anniversary is closer .
I will be taking part in the celebrations of commemoration .
I know Georgia is not going to go .
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I am not .
I warned at home that he could not help .
I am grateful to God for having returned to me , and here all of them are recorded in Beslan .
It remains in us .
Georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
It is difficult to accept that if something is so unfair .
He is a boy , he likes sport , but he cannot participate because of his knee .
He has been operating several times , but he cannot drive sport .
I would say that he has to pay 50 % of the horror , but it is never possible to overcome it and forget it .
This terrible experience will always follow us .
Many friends and neighbours were killed and strengthened only by my pain .
I have lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive .
My son is in my mind , and that is the greatest gift that God could make me , but my heart is wrestling around the beaten .
I know of families where new children were born , but also of widows who have never been secret again .
It is difficult to accept that life goes further , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget how my heart was going to go into me when I saw him in hospital .
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people fighting for ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country and I cannot believe it almost .
We were a friendly country earlier , how can we now fight ?
People and children suffer , I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many have been killed .
If we only want to attack all these rebels and move beyond them - as far as possible .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you like to make photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
The most cost @-@ effective option is a watertight point and shoot , as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , which are both for about $ 300 .
I have taken these photos on a family festival with several cameras that will be available all at a price of $ 350 .
Regardless of the equipment there are some rules for the best results .
Check your equipment twice .
Even if you have a water @-@ tight camera , make sure that the battery unit and other trailers are closed close .
Imagine your camera on the photos or videos you want to add .
Some cameras and camcorder have scenarios and recording modes that allow the exposure time for the curing of underwater conditions .
And before you jump into , check what depth your equipment works .
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 minutes , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
Search for our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and water @-@ tight models .
Make multiple photos - because many are not folded .
Point and shoot cameras have an LCD that lets you compile images , action cams usually do not .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see this under water and the right image setting is a gambling issue .
So make many pictures .
If your camera has a set mode that allows you to view a number of images with slightly modified exposure settings , use it .
Stay close to the surface .
The light is dramatically worse , depending on the surface you are going to remove .
If possible , you will be able to stay close to the surface if you want to see pictures in a pool , lake or sea .
This allows you to add more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
Go close to the objects .
This is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions .
It is particularly important that you deal with an action Cam : these devices often have a fixed wide angle intake , which means that you need to be dipped into your objects if they are to fill out the entire picture dragging .
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things , even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS .
As an advisory anaesthesiearzt he devoted his career to the task of preventing both the agony of the disease and the quale of treatment .
Under his patients , his wife , he was a MI6 employee who was involved in the devastating effects of torture .
Lawson knew that doctors were not important to diagnose and diseases , while treatment was mainly related to something quite different : pain .
One day in 2007 he was the one who was the leader of his career .
&quot; I did not feel like having written in May this year .
I had difficulty in getting up .
While he was with the grippelike symptoms , he noticed that he was not patient with his wife Juliet .
&quot; I want to do everything immediately as later as &quot; said he .
As Juliet for a week on a business trip , Lawson felt quite unusual and without cause for concern .
Irgendetwhat was in the air .
He asked a colleague to take a radar examination of his breast .
Only two weeks ago he was in the French Alps to ski .
The result of the X @-@ ray test was before .
He was a member of Mesotheliom , an uncurable cancer that caused breast fall , i.e. the skin that surrounds the lungs .
As with most cancer , the exact extinguishing is often difficult to determine .
While some smokers were suffering from lung cancer , not all lung cancer has been used earlier .
But Mesotheliom is different .
In almost all cases , the extinguishing is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material , which was once considered &quot; miracle &quot; but has now been recognized as deadly .
For most of us Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore .
Asbestos is finally a product of the past .
The most dangerous asbesttyp was found in Britain since the 1960 &quot; s , when industry voluntarily committed itself to using it .
There too , where he was still used , only people working in certain sectors worked directly with the substance - glue , construction workers , room staff and advertising workers , for example .
As an industrial vehicle from another time , it seems hardly worrying today .
But this self @-@ satisfaction is inappropriate .
Britain , it seems , is experiencing today &apos;s peak of a Mesoltheliom epidemic .
There are more deaths caused by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as they were when traffic accidents .
Every year , the numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are now witnessing the fatal effects , although Asbestos has been illegal for years ( 1999 all asbestos have been banned ) , is that a Mesotheliom has only developed after decades .
And the scourge of Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry .
Asbestos was , and is often still in the houses where we live , the offices where we work , schools where we learn and shops where we buy .
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers , financial limits , occupations or age .
The privileged bastions , from the elegant shops in London to private schools , are not a protective area .
Parliament buildings are contaminated .
In hospitals where we are healthy , too , we are already the starting point of this deadly carcinogens .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
He was not a Klempner either .
It fell into trouble to imagine where it might be possible to contact asbestos .
Then he found out .
&quot; It looks as if in tunnels at Guy &apos;s Hospital where I spent six years working my training , a lot of asbestos was available . &quot; he wrote .
All students , nurses , doctors and pentlers - use the tunnel .
One wonders how many of my old people will suffer from the same disease ?
This question was unfortunately able to answer at least partially .
&quot; From the four doctors who were at Guy &apos;s Hospital , and who were trained in Mesotheliom over the last five years , &quot; he wrote in 2010 in a letter , &quot; I am the last who still lives . &quot;
How many of us will suffer ?
Andrew Lawson was awarded Mesotheliom at age 48 .
When he died on 17 February this year , he was 55 .
That was an unusual long period of survival .
Fifty per cent of all MesotheliomDisease are dying within 8 months after diagnosis .
The disease is always fatal .
We can therefore only repeat Lawson &apos;s question : &apos; How many of us will be even more affected ? &apos;
The leading expert in Britain on Mesotheliom , Professor Julian Peto , takes note that between 1870 and 2050 , when the asbestepidemic in Britain is expected to come to an end , 90.000 of the disease will be victims .
Most of them have not yet given any idea that they will die .

A short look at the acts of the courts , which often affect the victims because of claims for damages , shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already spread .
In June this year Marks &amp; Spencer , for example , Janice Allen , was bound to have been subjected to asbestos .
She worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M &amp; S .
Now she has two children in forced zigars .
&quot; Before this matter , &quot; she says , &quot; I never heard of Mesotheliom , I knew nothing about asbestos .
I would never have thought that this would affect me .
There are few people who have a lot to know about asbestos .
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance but a group of six minerals .
The name comes from the word &quot; ascending form , &quot; a description of the fibre structure that resides the substance and makes it flexible .
Three of the six were used in construction .
Chrysotil , also known as white asbestos , is far from the most common asbestos in buildings .
It was designed for roof plates , floor boards , pipes insulations , drilling insulations , even for brake belts in cars .
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms , but it is still being used by the EU and the WHO as &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death .
Risk is , however , the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world &apos;s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspected that &quot; there was clear but indirect evidence that this is a major reason for the unique high measurement eliomrates . &quot;
A member of Marks &amp; Spencer was founded in the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street , London , Asbest exposed Alamy
Janice Allen has perhaps not been known as typical Mesotheliomopfer , but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her history is not unusual .
He has presented a study of those affected , stating that &apos; a significant proportion of Mesotheliome &apos;s measurement without known suspension by work or at home is probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment . &quot;
Most of these contacts are based on his statement on &quot; normal use and ageing &quot; of our buildings .
It looks as if nobody can assume that they will be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which was examined by the Palace of Westminster , shows how people are also in the heart of the government , unknowingly exposed to the substance .
2009 reported Goddard that service rights and pipelines were behind Parliament &apos;s committee rooms with Asbest contaminated , whose fatal fibers were so harmless as &quot; strong air movements . &quot;
Members of Parliament are often accused of their own interests being taken care of , but here it looks as if the opposite is true .
While the Direation of Parliament &apos;s work service was aimed at ensuring that the West Minster Palace had a &quot; clean health certificate , &quot; it is now undisputed that EUR 1 billion of work had to be spent over several years to rebuild Parliament , modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos , and that after the general elections in 2015 , Members would probably meet more closely with the nearby QE2 conference centre than on green benches in Western minster .
Goddard &apos;s report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of asbestos does not work according to the relevant provisions . &quot;
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life .
All that can be done now is waiting .
A person who has never defined contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott , a general medical .
As Andrew Lawson suggests , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old abbot that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
&quot; I worked in a hospital where asbestos were positively decided , &quot; he says , &quot; but I cannot prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to participate in all places where you have worked and where data is collected .
What he still remember is the day at the beginning of December 2009 , when he was so much a fever .
He was 45 , and he was just late in the evening .
Suddenly I had a joke .
It was suddenly coming .
I felt terrible .
I believed that the journey to home was no longer possible .
As a doctor , Abbott knew that pain from breast fall , skin around his lungs was caused .
But , as Janice Allen had no reason to suspect a Mesotheliom .
He did not work for a month .
It was surprising that RöntgenAufnahmen of his breast and put Pleurakathether into the wings to see fluid from the lungs and test them in the laboratory .
His complaints remain undiagnosed .
His health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
From time to time , the symptoms returned back , however , often after sporting activity and intense breathing .
In 2011 , a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom .
But now also association Abbott does not do so with his own case .
Finally , his patient was a few decades old and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection in the case was clear .
In September 2011 , depleted state again and his house doctor brought his CT Scans and X @-@ ray recordings to an expert group .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott became ill for the first time , a camera equipped with a sonde was built into the cave between the rip and breast fall .
I am an optimist .
I usually go further , &quot; he says .
Frankly , I had not had so many concerns .
But Rachel , my wife , was concerned .
The result of the Biopsie was in the week between Christmas and New Year : &quot; You told me that Mesotheliom was . &quot;
Graham Abbott : Diagnostic Mesotheliom
Suddenly , Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses , some of whom recommended to him to take a lawyer .
Only now does he describe the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; It turned out that Asbest was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where tubes often were isolated with asbestos , &quot; he says .
People who have been involved in these buildings are suffering from asbestos .
And so Mesotheliom is now more recent people who have not worked in typical professions .
The most dangerous pipes with ascending solid solid in hospitals were probably not exposed to the substance .
But many employees who are in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( like Andrew Lawson ) or in underground Kantines aßen ( as Graham Abbott often did ) came with the greatest probability in contact with the toxic substances .
It shows that over several decades after the war hospitals , patients could have been living life @-@ saving , but life @-@ threatening for doctors treated .
It will also be removed today .
Students were able to buy their federal combustion at asbestmatts .
And it is not only health houses .
Asbestos was born due to its wireless insulating and flame @-@ resistant properties often used in offices , shops , libraries and city halls .
schools too .
Indeed , many people probably have the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
All over the country , in thousands of chemical dogs , students have their federal combustion on asbestmatts .
On websites the theme Asbest is now frequently raised in schools .
And because they have so many innocent items in our houses like footboards or footboards or standard asbestos .
&quot; It is an industrial gift that contains large parts of our real estate , &quot; says Andrew Morgan , who is a lawyer who has been represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy &apos;s Hospital .
In one case , the only contact that came from a woman affected was the abyss of a garden shoe in the 1970 &quot; s .
So please adjust your garden shoes .
The effects of diagnosis , and knowledge that the disease is uncurable , is immense .
&quot; It takes a while to process it , &quot; says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to go further , but I noticed that I could not concentrate on what I did .
I was in practice two weeks ago .
Then I knew that I would go and take care of myself .
Na yes , I will not see another Christmas festival .
With the greatest difficulty , the change in the position of a doctor was to a patient .
How many patients remember before him is how overshadowed he was by all the information he had had to get .
&quot; It was very difficult to include everything , &quot; says he .
&quot; I asked my doctor how long I still have ? &quot;
And there were still about 12 months .
I remember that I thought that &apos; Na yes , I will not see another Christmas festival .
That was &apos; s then . &apos;
Mesotheliom is particularly intriguing because it is our life @-@ saving mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer .
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact .
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers .
If the asbestos are confused and the fibers are inhibited , they can be found in the breast fall , the skin around the lungs .
Asbestfibers irritate the breast and can cause cell mutations .
&quot; The problem arises with the inhalized nimic fibres , &quot; says Professor Tom Treasure , a heart thorax doctor who changed to Guy &apos;s Hospital in 2001 .
That is precisely what the hospital , by Andrew Lawson , suspect , has been exposed to asbestos , is now ironic , a leading centre in dealing with Mesotheliom .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who probably also had to be exposed during their training in hospital to asbestos .
Once the asbestnadles reach the lung tissue , Treasure says , &quot; they are &quot; taken from the respite process to the edge where the skin is .
From nature it is from the beginning invasiv .
The usual options for other cancer cancer are not working with Mesotheliom as well .
The effectiveness of an operation is , for example , controversial .
Some believe that they are worth an attempt .
Treasure is one of them .
&quot; You cannot cut the breast fall out , &quot; he says .
They come with the knife not around .
This is because cancer is not very good on chemotherapy , &quot; which &quot; effects show &quot; but does not cure .
&quot; Sometimes there are long @-@ term survivors , &quot; says Treasure .
But at the end of the day they die all .
Fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott still struggles .
After he was contacted Mesotheliom , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who had a four years after his diagnosis a man support and consulting office for the affected .
&quot; Hello , cancer center , &quot; he turned himself into a joyful before calling .
&quot; He was very positive , &quot; says Abbott .
He had his diagnosis four years before and was still very active .
Originally , Abbott was six chemotherapies that took six months and probably only extended his life to one month .
&quot; I was desperate , &quot; he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson managed to &quot; do things in a rather more positive light , however , &quot; to let him say . &quot;
After consulting several doctors , Abbott decided to improve his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang @-@ Lazdunski , heart @-@ Thorax specialist at Guy &apos;s .
&quot; We had an advantage by not having to go further , I simply called for and got an appointment , &quot; gives Graham .
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the treatment to be approved .
Money is crucial for Mesotheliom disease to find the best available therapies .
But if these treatments are ultimately misguided , many people are affected by another financial concern - about the future of families they leave .
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
&quot; It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says Morgan .
But what happened in the 1960 &quot; s was that one also knew that a very low burden was a health risk .
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy &apos;s Hospital finally put their case in place , but it was not what Morgan called a &quot; full compensation &quot; because Lawson did not show with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom could prove to be based on an asbestos contact with Guy &apos;s .
After the investigation into his death , a spokesman of Guy &apos;s confirmed that &quot; the asbestos fibers in the field concerned were removed in the 1990 &quot; s .
That was for Andrew Lawson too late .
As Asbestos can be removed
Indeed , it is important for Mesotheliom disease to seek compensation , a huge problem that deadly asbestos contact a company or workplace - usually decades after the events .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
Insurance documents can be lost .
And those who oppose claims are aware that time is for them , but certainly not with the buyers .
In response to this , there were clear new legislative proposals this year which would allow Mesotheliom to compensate for even if their former employers were no longer found .
The law has a policy of providing aid to the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 to identify a contact , but nobody can complain .
In these cases , the plaintiff receives 80 % of what a court would have liked to have said to them in a normal compensation process - about € 120,000 .
About 300 successful applications are expected to be received per year .
Andrew Morgan thinks how many Mesotheliom people affected that $ 350 million is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; This is a deal of insurers for insurers , &quot; he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if time had not gone away and Mesotheliom disease found companies and could find them normal .
Mike Penning , then working and pension ministers , also announced that the law &quot; is not perfect . &quot;
But both Penning and Morgan said that , given seven deaths per day , rapid action was needed .
&quot; People suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year .
To this point , Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang @-@ Lazdunski for 19 months .
After their first discussions Lang @-@ Lazdunski recommended an operation that he had , unlike Tom Treasure , had a positive effect .
This was caused by radiation therapy and therapy - a three @-@ speed therapy that allows Lang @-@ Lazdunski to exceed five years of life from up to 40 % .
Abbott felt strengthened .
&quot; This is of course the most important thing , &quot; says Abbott .
That is always true of patients .
There is something you can do about .
If you are looking for it , you will find it very fast .
Graham Abbott was born in March 2012 .
At the end of August he had the last of the six choemotherapies behind him .
The first time the disease was discovered , it was not possible to show any signs of illness .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There were several cancer spots around my breast .
I was just 50 .
This is not life @-@ threatening .
This is vital .
Once again , Abbott took six choemotherapies .
Now there is no trace of tumours more visible .
But the process is physically and psychologically very strict .
You must think about practical things - about money if I am no longer , for example , or my wife show how the boiler time is working .
If you receive bad news , you will be negative .
You must look forward .
As father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , is not always easy .
&quot; For parents , it is difficult to say . &quot;
It is difficult to know what to say and how much .
When I first received my diagnosis , I said my girls that I would have a disease with which I would not be old .
They responded very differently .
Tamsin is very healthy and unstalled .
They told them that they would be their friends and we would soon be very happy to hear many calls .
Ellie was back .
She did not say much .
Such talks are something that all cancer patients must do .
But for MesotheliomDisease , such talks have not been carried out by hope , not by a trace of hope of survival .
The disease causes ( as a funny coincidence for Stephen Jay Gould ) a grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , &quot; Mesotheliom is not life threatening .

China refuses Hong Kong right to choose government , demonstrators are bothering .
On Sunday , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against nomination of candidates for elections 2017 by Hong Kong &apos;s electorate .
This approach is probably the long @-@ awaited protests in Hong Kong &apos;s business district , while activists are planning and mobilising them within a few hours of the revelation .
The Chinese People &apos;s Congress &apos;s decision allows Communist leaders to make sure that all non @-@ pekingtretreven candidates are absent .
&quot; This does not come unexpectedly , but it is a question of saying &apos; Legal Expert Emily Lau , Chairman of the Democratic Party .
This is not what Beijing promised .
It has been the inhabitants of Hong Kong .
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
In his defence of China &apos;s decision Li Fei , Vice @-@ General of the Standing Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress , said that the approval of public nominations during the Hong Kong Government elections was &quot; chaotic . &quot;
Since 1997 , when Britain has withdrawn control over Hong Kong , Beijing has promised to protect its inhabitants from 2017 .
Chinese leaders presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong &apos;s citizens direct right to vote , but the decision also makes it clear that China &apos;s leaders are firmly keeping the process under a closely controlled nomination committee controlled by Beijing .
After a new clause , only candidates should be entitled to &quot; with love for the country and love Hong Kong . &quot;
The decision follows a summer when some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years .
Behind the pro @-@ democratic campaign in Hong Kong , Occupy Central With Love and Peace , whose organisers threatened to throw off the financial district if Beijing did not allow a genuine universal electoral right .
On Sunday evening , there was a little bit of time after the release of hundreds of Occupy Central supporters in the rain before the head office in Hong Kong .
In the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement would be a new stage of civil inaction and that they would plan to take refuge in the coming weeks .
They did not , however , make any more precise information , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online communication , the organizers shared that the movement &quot; would only be the occupation of the central district as a last resort , an action that should take place only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and no other choice exists .
I am sorry to say that today all the dialogue opportunities have been exploited and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
The Hong Kong authorities have been following the Beijing announcement for days and it is cold on Sunday before the government building strengthened security measures , including police forces and barricades .
The unrest is caused by the feeling of many people living in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
The movement of people from mainland increases competition for products and services .
Moreover , fear is growing that Hong Kong &apos;s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to be brushed under the growing pressure of Beijing .
Some critical of the Occupy Central movement &apos;s demonstrations , because they have been the business - the life savers of Hong Kong - at risk .
&quot; The protests that they talk about are potentially causing major economic damage , depending on how many people are involved and how long they continue to continue , &quot; said Legal Expert Regine Ip , who has long criticised the movement .
We do not want to worry that Hong Kong will be out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
The state controlled media of China reported recently about the democratic activists in Hong Kong as being led by Western powers .
In this summer activists organised an informal referendum on electoral rights , which was 78,000 people - more than one fifth of Hong Kong &apos;s voters .
In July tens of thousands of people took part in one of the greatest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region .
The tradition of school school graduates in the US is now transferred to universities where freshmen are offered with private aircraft .

To make a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , Rolls @-@ Royce Phantom , Aston Marten or McLaren P1 .
Mr Stewart also said that the service has a security saving .
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise have their habits in a dangerous overload car through the country .
Together with our new VIF options , we look forward to ensuring that the students can visit the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury this year .
A company speaker said that there were no new reservations before the service was introduced , but added that &quot; students would book the service in the next few weeks . &quot;
The company also stated that despite the cost of study , there was a market for this offer every year .
Students today differ greatly from students &apos; expectations and demands from 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression and VIF can be exactly that .
National student union criticised the service , however , as a depleted one .
Megan Dunn , Vice @-@ President of the NUS for higher education said : &quot; This offer seems completely separate from the lives of most students .
Many students who start this month with studying see a crisis of life costs being exposed , because available financial aid is in the form of credit and scholarships not with the much increasing bills for the simplest living conditions before they can even think about thousands of pounds being spent on the arrival in the student home .
Feminsts criticise racial question and police behaviour for Ferguson
The unarmed teens were arrested at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo.
Participants raised their hands in the air and soft , &quot; hands high , not shoot , &quot; while they warned before being damaged .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of the shooting of the unarmed teenagers Michael Brown , the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a change in online discussion of white feminists .
After her experience , white feminist commentators are putting gender before race when it comes to making reproductive rights and income inequality .
While tensions in the Middle West have increased , and throughout the country , Perez saw that the answers of white women were 100 % about race three .
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August , personal essays came with titles such as &quot; thoughts about Ferguson of a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism not only revolves around suppressing women &quot; relatively late .
But Perez meant that this was an important change .
&quot; I do not believe that many people can be found in feminism who are over the white and who have privileges in such a highly classic way , &quot; she said .
People felt forced to do something about the events .
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are located and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they must express that .
For English professionals Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University , Ferguson raised problems that black Americans face every day , but which are not considered as &quot; women &apos;s systems &quot; in the cultural space .
&quot; I can read something about Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere , &quot; said Mitchell .
If I could say something about how farmers in their own country are under Belagation , the silence is ohrenbetäubend .
&quot; How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in the public sphere ? &quot; she asked .
For black women like Mitchell , race , gender and sexuality in history of the US , there is no pootomy between racial and gender problems .
For them black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics clean ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women are now discussing race and gender in feminist mainstreaming , Angela Hattery says that professional women and gender research are linked to George Mason University that their predecessors have done the opposite .
&quot; Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were cast and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , &quot; said Hattery .
White women have had to be involved in history to stop the Lynchmord .
For Hattery , the split between white and black women came to the point where white fighters were fighting for women &apos;s right to vote , such as Susan B. Anthony , the country in the late years of the 19th century analysed and established that the fight for electoral law could only be successful for each group : women or black .
&quot; You met the decision to opt for women &apos;s right to vote and the right to vote should come later , &quot; said Hattery .
If you remember such things , a power that is deliberately why colourful women do not trust white women .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women to get their husbands and sons .
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , there was still a decade before white women were opposed to the Lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
The group was born almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , Mitchell says .
For Mitchell , the flute of white feminist reactions to the problems raised by Ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - is a mirror of time when white feminists &quot; feminists &quot; struggles &quot; with the problems faced by black women have been intertwined for generations .
&quot; Would it not be great if the activists who have been involved in such traditional feminist platforms had the right to education a child as seriously as they would do with the right to receive receiving control ? &quot; Mitchell said .
Feministers of the second generation who have been working on fighting reproductive rights and access to emptive contraceptive contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means .
The famous feminist activist Gloria Steiner went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article of Rebecca Carroll , Columnistin of Guardian , which asked for more protests from white Americans on racism .
&quot; I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to do so will be able to avoid a risk that is incomparable to the body - and opinions on race , which are clearly different in public surveys - will be referring to changes , &quot; wrote Steiner .
Although stones are used for a rather intersectional feminism , where racial and gender issues are raised , some of their comments on the racial issue in America are still astounding .
Christina Sommer , Research Director at the American Enterprise Institute and author of &quot; Who Stole Feminism ? &quot; said to her The People that young men in the United States , especially young colourful men , are far more vulnerable than their sisters , &quot; but Steinems &apos;s comments on Ferguson stand contrary to their previous criticism .
There are now hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House recently adopted a small programme , My Brother &apos;s Keeper , to prevent vulnerable young black and hispanic men , there were poorer reactions from many feminists , including Gloria Steiner .
The relationship between the police to the black community is not the only problem that has been pressing for mainstreaming .
After the US border police had almost 63.000 unaccompanied minors in the south @-@ west border of the country this year , the issue of immigration reform is also coming back to the surface - this time as a women &apos;s scheme .
Andrea Mercado , Co @-@ Chairman of We Belong Together , an organisation that mobilises women for immigration reform , said that for a re @-@ consideration of the issue as an essential women &apos;s scheme they only need to publish the stories of immigrants .
&quot; These speak for themselves , &quot; says Mercado .
If the vast majority of the visa is going to be paid to male immigrants , women who accompany it are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; These stories can be found in women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .

The SW city Harvey is heated after Lottogewinn a new millionaire
A lottery player from Harvey this month is dran
The search for a new millionaire in the south @-@ west of Perth takes place with a happy winner who was almost 1.1 million dollars out of lottery on Saturday .
A time @-@ cycle in Harvey moved to five years to the jackpot in the final division after 1 million dollars in November 2009 .
The lucky winner must , however , report .
The owner Steve Forward said that profit provision for interlocutors in the small town of Perth is in the south @-@ west of Perth .
The city is not talking about anything else , and everyone is quite excited .
We thought that such profit could occur .
Eight WA winners have won the first division last month , a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state .
In the last week , a player from Canning Vale was elected one of the five millionaires in August after a spouse from Belmont was only a few weeks before the mega gain from $ 7.5 million .
The winner couple had played since 20 years and said that the profit allowed them the opportunity to win a world record and buy a new house .
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
Leonidas asked for the Gladiatorenarena
Not only the Gladiators were ill @-@ advised in the Matsch at the first Rhine Bacher Römertag in the leisure park .
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to inform about 1000 visitors who were able to visit the rainviews and the cold cold and who were unenthusiastic about the historical spectacle .
There was a colourful rich of representations , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhine .
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Moroccan fighter group of Gladiatorenschule &quot; Amor Mortis , &quot; which used every rainy recess to create their robust combat fighting force in the area marked with soft sand .
Gladiatorenbesitzer &quot; Leonidas &quot; proved to be humorous and factual presentation and sent his men to each other into the ring to the heroic two @-@ fight in various gladiators .
First of all , the &quot; provocators &quot; were on the line with rectangular signs and short sword as well as on left legs and armor on the right arm .
It followed the &quot; Essedarii &quot; with breast shield , short sword and root flanks , as well as iron Gladiatorenhelm , bein- and armor protection .
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the &quot; Retiarius , &quot; which was connected with root net , trizack and dollar against the Secutor , and recently fought to ground the Bursh .
Since strong metal alarms are angry each other , the shield sheppered and the sausages flowed surrend through the arena that was afraid and bange could become the health of Gladiators .
But it was the imposant &quot; Summa Rudis , &quot; who was musculous Shield , an always attentive eye .
&quot; We wanted to live up to the Roman daily life and experience the culture of Roman times , &quot; said Lorenz Euskirchen , Chairman of the event &quot; Freundeskreis Römerkanal , &quot; who was intent behind the spectacel .
After two years of preparation , the leisure park for a day was a &quot; Oppidum Romanum , &quot; a Roman city like Vice President Claus Wehage in his greeting word .
Finally , the Romans have not only war and conquest in our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today .
Overriding these were also astonished at the Roman Day , such as &quot; Aquedukt @-@ Marmor &quot; from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman bridge , which once stood at Lüftelberg .
The Frontinus society was the water and energy supply once and now , and managing director Petra Fricke knew : &quot; We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then . &quot;
This also confirms diploma measurement engineers Ralph Heilige from the &quot; Engineering Office Two &quot; from Rheinbach , the measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat , Groma or Dioptra .
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketch and models of the excavations anno 1894 and brick stones from the original hypothesis , the warm air heating that once heat the Roman villa .
The pressure also reduces the footprints that were caused by Wolf and Fuchs before two years ago in the footsteps of sound , before you could see them .
In 2011 , the office of ground care at the Landesverband Rheinland had the overrests of a Roman villa in the North of Rheinbach commercial park .
You have built up walls of an economic building with a darre to dry grain and to mold .
The building probably has to be a villa Rustica , an agricultural property , explained the Archaeological Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser .
A number of foundations from these excavations were they in a glass vitrine , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a zierical halfette .
Villa has probably been built from the first to fourth century to Christ , until the fall of the German people in the then Roman Rhine , Morscheiser believes .
In her work , children also worked with the Roman windmill game , similar to today &apos;s mate game , or they wrote their names with metal attacks on them .
At the stand of the Roman thermal baths , children were allowed to take Mosaiken himself , at the stand of the Glasmosaiken Museum Rheinbach Glasmosaics basteln and at the stand of the Natural Center Eifel Nettersheim to serve the flour for a floral brot or Müsli .
With the two caltbbbres of original , faithful Roman travel cars , visitors went through the leisure park and came to the impressive stand of the city Gymnasium , which gave the results of their &quot; Romans project twoches . &quot;
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September , the municipality Wachtberg will also be located in the Rhine @-@ based Roman period 2014 , which will be the death of Emperor Augustus before 2000 .
Together with the home and history associations and the Wachtberger Wander Association , the partnership association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem , among others , will be thematic hikes , a lecture , cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes and remember the Roman past Wachtbergs .
It will be a Roman legion , for example , from his work on the adjoining Wachtberg , to tell plants as living monuments from Roman times and to provide a great teacher hour in international understanding between a group Wachtberger &quot; Germanen &quot; and admitted Romans .
The Adendorfer primary school is dedicated to a project programme that will address the Roman theme .
With the Roman week , the numerous but often not more visible traces of the Roman in Wachtberg are to be learned again .
In the Wachtberger Town Hall , a small presentation will be presented to the Fund of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879 .
Ebola : The epidemic is putting Western Africa &apos;s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
Markets are wavering - and international companies are moving away .
The devastating Ebola epidemic makes Western Africa &apos;s economy a serious blow .
The harvest is rotated on the fields that are mines and markets are left - the virus has been hard hit by the region .
Some international companies are already going to distance themselves .
&quot; The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic &quot; urges the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka .
Liberia is the hardest affected
&quot; It is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says Alhaji Bamogo , who is on the second largest market in Liberia &apos;s capital Monrovia clothing .
On the market , only those who produce food or something to disinfection against Ebola are buying .
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus , alone here fell the fever more than 600 people .
Recently , health authorities declared that the disease was in any corner of the country .
In Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria , too , the virus has spread out .
Overall , more than 1500 people have already died , thousands of others have been contailed .
Foreign companies draw employees from abroad
All in the resource rich countries are using companies to operate .
Foreign companies such as Arcelor Mittal steel companies are driving their employees , several international airlines are not flying the regions affected anymore .
The local dealers and farmers too react : few traders leave their homes to hide their backgrounds .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , which are under quarantine , among others , the measures for export of important cocoa and coffee beans on the fields .
Farmers do not dare to pay for their homes .
Food is scarce
&quot; People are always less likely to travel , &quot; says Phillipe De Vreyer , Paris expert for the West African economy .
The man who usually goes on to the market and sell his vegetables remains at home .
The population therefore receives the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is scarcely being treated .
On markets , the Board of First Instance is disappearing on basic food such as rice .
At the same time , the region of China &apos;s highly dependent region threatens to be an image - with far @-@ reaching consequences .
The greatest danger is that international companies will be able to control the area for a long time , says Philippe Hugon from France &apos;s Think Tank Iris .
What is crucial is how far and how long the virus will spread .
Investors can feel that it is dangerous to invest in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus invest in it , &quot; warns Hugon .
The disease also affects the criminal budgets of the Member States .
The disease also affects the already tightened national budgets of the countries concerned .
The Moody &apos;s rating agency fears that its budget will be heavily affected by high expenditure on health systems and , in addition , by the deteriorating economy .
The African Development Bank promised to support health systems of the countries affected with $ 60 million ( EUR 45 million ) .
Spurring are already in Nigeria , where there are few Ebola cases so far .
Although oil rich region in southern Nigeria has not been affected so far .
But elsewhere , many people are already afraid of contagion at home .
Reservations in hotels are also clearly back .
Protect your 50th anniversary .
The Schützenverein &quot; Tannenwald &quot; Berngau celebrates its 50 @-@ year @-@ old foundation from 12 to 14 September .
On high @-@ speed tours , the Schützenverein Tannenwald will be preparing for the 50 @-@ year @-@ old foundation festival from 12 to 14 September .
plans are scheduled on Friday 12 September , a great entertainment evening with the group &quot; Dorfrocker . &quot;
On Saturday at 18 a.m. the big floor was shot .
Then there is a big festival table with the &quot; Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam . &quot;
Blaskapelle provides for music
The highlights of Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 p.m. in the parish church and the great festival around 14 am .
In the afternoon , the price distribution of the Federal and Gauschießens is also available .
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 festivities with their Dirndln .
Fixed is the Blaskapelle Berngau .
The patronage has mayors Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker .
The original name &quot; Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau &quot; originates from 1907 when the association was founded on 21 March to &quot; Social entertainment through exercise in room use and microcaliber shooting . &quot;
The NS regime had signed the resolution in 1937 .
Only in 1964 , 19 young men found themselves again who were on 30 April in the inn Lukas , the &quot; new &quot; Schützenverein &quot; Tannenwald &quot; Berngau from the Taufe .
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a guardian by a difficult start period , where it was mainly about finding a local association and installing the shutter operation .
Already in autumn 1965 , the Schützenverein started in the Gasthaus Leininger with two teams in the Rundenwettkämpfen .
In the years following , sport protection , which has now been organised in seven teams , has been established in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga .
The recorder of purzelten allyearly and the magical border of 380 rings was first discovered by Rudi Meier in 1980 .
As the efficiency of active protection has increased , the members have also developed positively .
After the &quot; Leininger &quot; association has not been able to meet the demands of a modern protection association , the former former position has changed under the leadership of Johann Rinn to the cellar rooms of the new &quot; Landgasthof Härteis &quot; a future domicile .
After a work of 2700 hours , on 8 May 1988 parish street for the new protection rooms gave the church blessing .
One of the great highlights in the history of association was certainly the 44th palate , connected with the solemn white of the new protective flag in July 1991 .
On 23 and 24 April 1994 , the Schützenverein has opened its 30 @-@ year @-@ old anniversary .
1995 is a Bllerggruppe founded .
Josef Schmalzl was born Böllerreferent .
A major challenge for the &quot; Böllerer &quot; and for the association as a whole was the focus of the Bavarian Böllertreffens 2005 .
In many hours of honest work , the members of the Association have been able to present the rooms and the sliding system in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus to bring them up to date with the latest technology .
Elf teams in Rundenwettkämpfen
View can also be seen the sporting services of the protection association .
Overall , 11 teams are currently taking part in the round @-@ fighting : six air @-@ fired teams , an air pistols team , a sports pistols KK1 , a youth and two AH teams .
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich , Katharina Ellrich , Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann is in the round of 2013 / 14 from Gauoberliga ( highest league in Schützengau ANB ) in the district liga 1 .
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier , Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml is from Gauliga Nord to Gauliga Nord .
In addition to the shining sport , events such as bockstechen , fake and queen ball , club trips and Christmas celebration have tradition .
With this , protection is also essential for the festivities in parish and community .

&quot; I am quite happy today to see a good result , &quot; said Johnston and added : &quot; It was simply not turned off . &quot;
Not long after the second accident Stewarts was loaded into the Schlepper and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car had a different driver at an Aschenbahnrennen in the north of New York and killed .
He decided to return this week and either to Atlanta or to win the next race in Richmond to win a place in persecution .
He returned to his job , while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20 @-@ year Kevin Ward Jr. , which was during a race on the road to confront Stewart .
The authorities shared on Friday that the investigation into the cause of accidents will continue at least two weeks .
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will have to pay for a charge .
The three @-@ digit champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race .
After starting 12 position , Stewart was already short after the first 10 predictions and was temporarily on place four .
After a new start in round 122 , geriet Buschs
Cars with no 18 except control after the exit from Kurve 2 and collided with Stewart , both cars drove against the wall .

NATO wants agreements with Russia not to break down
NATO is being replaced by the planned deployment in Eastern Europe following Ukraine &apos;s crisis .
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO believes in the founding agreement of NATO @-@ Russia Council of 1997 .
NATO &apos;s chief accused , however , of &quot; a sharp break &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; Today we must look at reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner , &quot; so Rasmussen .
From documents and opinions from Russian side , it is clear that they consider us as an opponent .
Greater NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that NATO will be able to strengthen its presence in Eastern Europe .
A meeting in Wales at NATO summit called &apos; Readiness Action Plan &apos; will ensure that &apos; we have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as necessary &apos; said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels .
Kiev and Moscow are moving towards new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have official information that new talks on how to deal with their gas dispute have been reached .
The negotiations will be scheduled for next Saturday , said the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday .

Europe is about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources , which is a large part of which Ukraine is going through .
Merkel speaks power word : look &quot; quite clearly &quot;
Now , the Chancellor is still saying clearly that .
A poll for all complicated details is not .
Hartnäckäcken &apos;s concerns from the CDU against cars toll have brought CSU to an end .
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been forced to take part in the German Federal Chancellor &apos;s continued resistance to introduce a car toll .
&quot; To be quite clear , it is in the coalition treaty and it will come , &quot; said the party party party party parties on Monday after meetings of the CDU top bodies in Berlin .
On a detailed model , Merkel did not see itself .
In black @-@ red government programs , &quot; certain parameters &quot; are called .
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) has made a proposal , and this will now continue to work . &quot;
The NRW @-@ CDU insists on its no @-@ one to a toll on all roads .
Merkel stressed that finance ministers Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) also contributed constructively to the discussions on a draft legislation .
Over and above this subject he also talked about other possibilities , including more private capital for investment in infrastructure , such as broadband expansion .
&quot; As nothing special is dran . &quot; Schäuble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report uncommented on Sunday , his house examined a concept to make car investors with volume revenue - after the election of 2017 .
CSU leader Horst Seehofer warned then that in Kabinet Mautkonzepte he would be able to develop against the leading minister .
CDU @-@ Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections .
&quot; The coalition agreement never came about to remove all the roundabout and federal roads , &quot; said the North Rhine @-@ Westphalia CDU chairman .
In this respect , it is an important signal that hake now announced that once again we are talking about the subject .
Resistance against plans is also made by the CDU national associations Baden @-@ Württemberg and Rheinland @-@ Pfalz .
Background concerns that a toll would lead to a reduction in small border traffic to neighbouring countries .
Seehofer had a great deal of experience because of the Mautkritik from the CDU Koalitionstreue .
The left sees plans in view of the dispute in the Union as a failure .
&quot; Murks @-@ Maut is dead , &quot; said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the &quot; New Osnabrücker Zeitung &quot; ( Monday ) .
&quot; With the toll , the Minister fails . &quot; Dobrindt wants a vignettenpflicht on all German roads that should start 2016 .
domestic car owners may not be allowed to pay additional charges under the Coalitions Treaty .
Therefore , they should be informed about the Kfz tax to ensure full compensation for the toll .
The model must not be allowed to be used for foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality .
Genetic disorder often misdiagnoses
A British says that she thought she was a result of a misdiagnosis of many years ago that she would die .
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in faith that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease .
They actually went to Charcot @-@ Marie @-@ Tooth disease ( CMT ) - a group of inherited disruptions that could cause nerves outside the brain and back mark .
Charity CMT UK announced that maldiagnosis is a common problem with humans with CMT because it is not known about this disease .
About 23,000 people in Britain probably suffer from CMT , which leads to motor disturbances such as muscle weakness , an unsafe course and crammed tents .
Disease also affects disparity feeling or pain , and the disease is uncurable and progresses , which means that symptoms will become worse with time .
As Rodgers 13 , they believed that they would be part of Friedreich @-@ Ataxie ( FA ) - a disease with very poor chances of survival .
Rodgers thought they would sit in the wheelchair before they would die 18 , and before their 30 birthday .

Tax burden on business people in Washington is increasing with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax modest for companies in the country rose slightly last year , while economic recovery accelerated , so a newly published study last week , and companies in the Washington area did not constitute an exception .
Companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia paid $ 27,6 billion in government and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 % compared to 2012 &apos;s revenues of EUR 26,6 billion .
State and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 % last year to 671 billion dollars , compared to 3.9 % earlier , and the third growth year was due to the various years of declining motives 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes increased more than local taxes to 4.3 % , so the study carried out by Ernst &amp; Young with the Centre for State Tax , a tax group .
More than half of the tax revenue of the District , 56 % , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 % of the revenue from Maryland originates from companies .
Virginia achieved with 28 % the lowest tax revenue from companies .
Most of the rise in tax revenue is in a recovery of the real estate values of companies , say researchers what could lead to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 % this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 % .
While a large part of these profits from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the outcome seems to be true for the Washington area .
Companies in the district , Maryland and Virginia paid together over $ 10 billion in government and local property management last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase over a year by 4.2 % .
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in Maryland when increasing government and local tax revenue , since real estate taxes are reduced to just over a fifth of tax @-@ modest companies .
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; In Maryland , the following is : a large part of real estate , especially in the tax area around D.C. , is either owned by the government or by non @-@ profit organizations who do not pay property taxes , &quot; said Douglas Lindholm , Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to focus much more on income taxes , for example , to provide the same services that other states offer .
The recent recovery in tax revenue by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market .
Company revenues seem to be recovery , so data .
Companies in the region reported income taxes for state organisations of $ 2.3 billion compared to EUR 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount of the region .
During the trend in the same direction , local tax burdens on companies are not rising to all three places .
The increase in the district is between 4.3 % and 4.3 % of the national average , while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 % .
Only Virginia reported an average tax rate of 4.1 % .
Virginia has a total of 6 % in all three official areas , with a significantly lower corporate tax rate ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 % and is at relatively high 9.975 % in the district .
A comparable study by the US Trade Chamber at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia fewer state and local companies are required to impose tax duties and that there is a better tax climate than in Maryland .
In the study , the district was not investigated .
Despite the advantages , Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours .
North Carolina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 % to 6 % , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 % next year .
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the government &apos;s income tax rate by 2017 to 3 % .
In the meantime , it seems better for small businesses in Washington to go better , and therefore they pay more government and local taxes , as the recent study .
Corporate taxes , which are used as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure whereby most small businesses are organised - are in the district , Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20 % to $ 2.4 billion , a much faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole .
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes in the whole country will probably continue this year , with an increase in overall multi @-@ defense tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 % in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period of the previous year .
Nevertheless , the Washington area could be lagging behind if the devaluation of the Federal Government were to focus on the labour market in the region .
Partner city : German beer for Guangzhou
Hopfen and Malz - also in China a popular combination .
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China .
Written partner city in China now wishes a brewery and hopes to have a flight direct connection between the two cities .
German beer , used in Frankfurt &apos;s partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent desire of the officers in China .
&quot; We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to be turned into our city , &quot; said Vize party secretary of South China &apos;s metropolis , Li Yiwei , this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city .
Time and again , the officials of the ruling Communist Party of China came to this point during the discussion of this concern of the Tölf million metropolis .
Guangzhou , who also refers to Kanton in Germany , is one of China &apos;s richest cities , warb Li .
That is why people also took advantage of purchasing power to make clear beer .
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer @-@ Gümbel , who led the German political delegation , said to the host that he would be in Germany after a possible partner for the project .
&quot; For beer it does not need much : good water , cereals and joy of life , &quot; he added to lunch with the party top in Guangzhou .
This joy of life has already been apparent by Mr Li , who was the host .
This was then the function of Guangzhou with Schäfer @-@ Gümbel - but with red wine that was served for food .
Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewery art .
Tsingtao beer is produced according to the German pure offer .
More business traffic
A second wish of Chinese hosts would be a flight direct between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , said Vize party leader Li .
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 it was withdrawn for economic reasons .
&quot; It would be worth again , &quot; showed the local political leader .
&quot; The business relationship between our two cities is growing ever further . &quot;
At present , travellers should be able to move beyond Changsha in the province of Hunan , Li .
The administration of Guangdong province , whose capital is Guangzhou , also hopes to be connected to air .
Vize Governor of the province , Chen Yunxian , put this desire to speak with the Social Democrats .
&quot; This is a very good idea , &quot; replied Schäfer @-@ Gümbel - the Chinese vice @-@ president Li Jinjun , an intimate acquaintaner of Germany , nickte agreed .
The Partnership
The empty Vize party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to become a partner meeting next year .
Li Yiwei was already on the Main , but not yet in this function .
He came to office this year after his predecessor was accused of corruption charges from office .
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go .
The action against officials from Guangzhou is part of a country @-@ wide campaign against corruption in party and administration , which was conducted by Heads of State Xi Jinping with härte .
The new leader Li Yiwei had a political career in front of his party career for an American company , which is highly unusual in China &apos;s Communist Party .
Before his inauguration in Guangzhou he was the leading functional in Fujian where the motorway VW was built a large plant .
Frankfurt is officially more than a dozen cities partnership .
The connection to the 9000 km away Guangzhou is one of those who are maintained by both sides , for example by means of a student exchange .
Last year , the 25 @-@ year existence of German @-@ Chinese links was celebrated .
The South China metropolis on the perlfluent is almost as strong as it is with its economic power .
In the next year they want to see a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion , Li reported .
Family of Joan Rivers &quot; is pressing the Daumen &quot;
Joan Rivers has been in hospital since its delivery in New York City before three days ago , but her daughter showed himself today hopeful that the 81 @-@ year comiker of her illness will recover .
&quot; Thank you for your continued love and support , &quot; Melissa Rivers said today in a communication .
We are pressing all the Daumen .
Your mother was given sources that on Thursday after an emergency due to heart closure in a clinic at Upper East Side , Yorkville Endoscopy , in which Mount Sinai hospital was delivered .
Doctors consider them to be sealed and under precise observation until they are satisfied with their state of affairs , which is still described as &apos; serious &apos; .
The reactions came from many sides , including in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump , Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa .

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
AMAZON confirmed just now what information was reported on Monday morning : the online retail dealer - and video producer , and a variety of other things - buys the video streamingdienst Twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( $ 970 million ) .
The announcement is surprising , not because nobody expected to take Twitch , but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company .
Three months ago , it was as if the sale of Twitch was to be on Google &apos;s video service for a coole billion decided , and cooperation also appeared naturally .
Twitch , which was first released three years ago as Justin.tv , was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it was quickly becoming a platform for players who had published their bravourings in games , a YouTube for live games , so an insider .
Twitch interface .
And &quot; let &apos;s play , &quot; a video genre where Besserwisser uses ( mostly older ) games a hint of secrecy theatre , are already very popular on YouTube .
It is precisely that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch , so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was taken into account , a teacher book game of established technology that bought a potential competitor .
It is a puzzle why the Deal did not come into being with YouTube because the company reported that it was ready to pay as much as Amazon .
All we are now aware of is this statement by Emmet Shear , President of Twitch : &apos; We decided to Amazon because they share our community believe they share our values and long @-@ term visions and they want to help us reach it faster . &apos;
Another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
For Snobs like me who say that they prefer to drive sport rather than see it , it is difficult to understand the attraction that assumes that others are playing games rather than taking control console into their hands .
It is one thing to be a friend for 3 p.m. in the morning , while she was elected by Resident Evil , and something quite different , a spinner in how he could look back 20 times in Call of duty in head .
All these games could be seen right now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego games , so the addition can be done without own control over the perspective is a good recipe for headache .
I admit that the rapid processes that Roger Bannisters has carried out in our electronic newspaper are complete throughout record time , are entertaining .
But until a game or humorvirtuosis is in place , his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
But what do sceptics know ?
Twitch is used by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peak .
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it ?
It is difficult to imagine that Twitch is so elegant in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch simply would have liked to have swallowed .
But Twitch has something that everyone would like to have liked : thousands of young men who are being turned into advertising dogs .
As the chairman of Twitch , Shear , said Amazon and Twitch , &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium does not show signs of a shrinking , nor even - luck - as spectators sport .
On the Hüpfburg hill at the castle festival , there was little left on Sunday evening .
The concept of organizers agreed .
Despite the strong rain on Saturday evening , an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the castle garden .
Time was time to stop taking .
&quot; This was annoying , &quot; said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel light and fun .
For two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula .
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to increase brightness on the day and evening by various shows .
Na , and fun comes from here .
This has already been shown at the early Sunday evening when the first visitors were invited to open air .
A festival for all generations had promised the organizers .
And that has been achieved .
Around the supply conditions on the Burggartenwiese , Salzwedeler , but also guests from the nearby and more comfortable surroundings .
They followed the first live performances , wipped with the foot in the tact , enjoyed cool drinks - short : relaxation pure and enjoyment were said .
And this across generations .
While one of the items on ceiling on the extra carved white sand on the beach bar was on the other side of a quarter of wine in the Vinothek labten , the growth on the Hüpfburg hill , which was a great attraction for smaller guests .
But also in the case of child shortages , voluntary helpers had their hands fully in the true sense of the word to become the Andrang Mr and fantasievolle creations in the small faces .
The larger users used the kicker tables or the participating ones at a Skateboard workshop that was designed by Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel .
Until the great rain came .
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he praised visitors , especially families sought the soft and dry .
But attractiveness of the festival did not cause a break .
&quot; There were more people than expected , &quot; said Ron Sem , who was talking about a &quot; success on the whole line . &quot;
That is why we are faced with a repetition of the great party next year .
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked , Sem made a first assessment on Sunday against the popular timme .
As an annoying fact , he said that the time limit had to be stopped .
Obviously , the security company was booked with too little power .
The result is that some who had already paid have not come to the ground anymore .
The resonance was very good .
In a first cautious estimate , the saltwater Mitorganiser spoke of about 1200 visitors who were gathered in the castle garden tumour .
Problems have arisen in sound technology .
The salt beet Hip @-@ Hop band Blocksendy n&apos; Rox broke her appearance .
The technicians were unable to reach a half @-@ way sound .
The planned Shisha Lounges could not be built because the tents were not built because of a tyre pan .
&quot; In the next year they will be &quot; the organizer .
The premiere of Amula @-@ Open Airs was more than successful by the visitors .
And this is bad weather .
However , the organizers have made some mistakes which will be made for the first time , but must be removed from the second edition .
In the social network Facebook , the organizers must also make criticism .
&quot; Sorry , but for 12 euros you simply have expected more , &quot; Melanie Meier refers to the event page .
&quot; You unfortunately took you a little , &quot; says Ele Zimmermann at the same place .
Others see the initial problems not as closely as they are .
I think it is very good that some people are not only stupid but also really try to put something on their legs .
Hut ! &quot; says Stephanie Jenß to Amula .
Now the organizers will have a year to discuss these criticisms .
New Radom in Berkum : Wachtbergs landmark shrines
That is expected , according to the rules .
Instead , the building part that is ready to be built in the market @-@ rich building is waiting for it .
The action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the creation of space observation radar TIRA , the hull , the so @-@ called radar , is completely renewed .
The new radar is equipped with a diameter of 47.5 metres slightly smaller than the old one .
The size remains global record .
The last step towards completing the new hull is to exchange the bill
The upper quarter of the old hull is separated and separated with a tie .
Then the last quarter of the new hull is set .
If the weather plays together , the action should be taken at the beginning of this week .

Drawing the castle &apos;s doors soon back to a stack ?
Finally , there has always been pressure between the two clouds of Burgundy .
Now the preconditions for cooperation are thinking about possible .
As a model for reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle , Richard Dimbath , former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde , launched the project in French Guédelon .
Even before a year ago , there was no good climate between the castle club and the castle &apos;s Wolfratshausen .
It was said that the positions of the past were different , such as the history of Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction .
Now the two camps move together : they will soon have to hold talks on a common approach .
This confirms the compatibility of Torsten Sjöberg ( Burgverein ) and Herbert Piffl ( Burgfreunde ) on demand of our newspaper .
&quot; I have called Mr Piffl and proposed that we could once again join together , &quot; reports Sjöberg .
His view could be that all members of both clubs could return to a stumbling .
So it is possible to see more visible results quickly .
While the castle friends around the suddenly late Richard Dimbath until last saw a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest , the castle club is at Sjöberg the &quot; exploration and experience &quot; of the river at the forefront .
Herbert Piffl , Zweiter Chairman of the Burgfreunde , has been following his own information about the call .
Since Dimbaths died he has been the lodge of the castle .
A new chairman should be present in mid @-@ September in a member meeting .
At present , the association is one of the 74 years old , about 40 members .
&quot; After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we have first left the association activities out of respect , &quot; this &quot; thought phase &quot; was necessary to consider how it could continue . &quot;
According to Piffl , the new chairman will then go into the discussion with the castle club .
Until then , the castle friends could also have an up @-@ to @-@ date vote within their group .
A candidate for the Presidency is not yet there , Piffl says .
&quot; But I am confident that someone will find themselves &quot; ; he does not want to stand because he wants his residence in Bad Tölz .
The new chairman should be a cloud @-@ bearer .
The Tölzer wants to participate in the project &quot; but very much like to continue working . &quot;
The different positions on reconstruction will be in the eyes of Piffls in the near future .
He appreciates Dimbath as &quot; missionary , &quot; who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar , advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock .
By making a high contribution to the population and by voluntary aid from all over the world , they are a tourist magic net .
Piffl : &quot; I was sceptical at the beginning .
But over time I am more and more convinced that it is useful to continue the project . &quot; It can be a &quot; single feature &quot; for the flames city .
Here you can &apos;t find anything else .
Moreover , the project would be supported by EU subsidies , visitors &apos; tickets and potential sponsors , Piffl believes .
&quot; The idea of reconstruction does not want to be simply &apos; put forward &apos; , and I hope that the castle club will perhaps move in this respect .
Their aim is to document history first , &quot; is important and good . &quot;
After that , we could see .
Clevere ways of saving at Uni textbooks
Since the cost of Uni teachers for many students is more than $ 1,000 per year , the almost two @-@ day student Matt Schroeder has developed a clever austerity idee .
He found a guide system for books of students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale .
&quot; My mathematical book costs 180 $ , but I got it for 10 $ for a semester and a chick @-@ fil A @-@ Keks , &quot; said Schroeder , 19 who visited Covenant College in Georgia .
The last book needed for the last semester would have cost $ 430 , he said .
He gave $ 120 .
Colleagues informed with students on average more than $ 1,200 per year for textbooks and study material that there would be different cost @-@ saving options for students .
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution for students .
The rent of textbooks is popular , and so students can book a semester long , often at a much cheaper price than when buying .
Neebo Inc , which has more than 250 university bookstores , announced that the rent of text books has doubled since 2011 .
Ask in the industry that about one quarter of books in college books last spring show that there was a Vice President Tevov Tevor Meyer .
Less than half of all textbooks are published according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores in Campus bookstores .
Here is the one for the best deeds .
Online buy
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are available in Campus bookstores .
The ninth edition of &quot; Calculus &quot; vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be found in the specialized textbook retail Chegg.com for $ 239.99 .
Use of this ?
If one of the notices of other or normal uses is not a matter of substance , used books are a good option .
&quot; Calculus &quot; is needed on Chegg.com for 93.49 $ .
Matt Casaday , 25 , graduates at Brigham Young University , says that he spent 42 Cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of &quot; Strategic Media Decisions : Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business . &quot;
The book was sold for 48 $ .
Academicians such as Ingrid Bracey , Director of University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether previous expenditure is permissible .
Sometimes the updates for seminars are not relevant .
In such cases older expenditure can often be used for a fraction of the costs of the latest edition .
Apart from Chegg and Amazon , Half.com is also a popular alternative for used books .
Rent
The rent of textbooks is worth considering if you agree with them quite well , remember to return them and not keep them back and you do not want to keep the books after the course has been completed .
You can buy more than 80 % of the cost of a new book .
A student could , for example , &quot; Calculus &quot; for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
Find out about the terms of the business you rent , including the fees imposed on you for writing notes , submissions or used documents .
Mieter adapts : If you do not return the book , the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book .
E @-@ Books
E @-@ Books instead of traditional textbooks are an option .
Sometimes these books are de facto mixed by an electronic license for a certain period of major dealers such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. .
Chegg can be called Calculus for 6 months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers because many classics can be downloaded free of charge today , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
Sich in any case .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books , since you can be sure to find the right textbook .
And before an online order , you should check if the book is actually premature .
This lesson learned him to the hard tour .
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and paid the full price at College Book .
Why &quot; Guardians of the Galaxy &quot; no cassenger was not ?
&quot; The Expendables 3 &quot; by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the US , while &quot; Sin City : A lady to Kill For &quot; only $ 12 million of his budget was played by $ 70 million .
The new version of the film &quot; Sex Tape &quot; which was designed on Cameron Diaz was only $ 14,6 million during the opening week , while children &apos;s films like &quot; Drachenzähmen easily made 2 &quot; appear to be disappointing with revenue .
An article of the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that the child &apos;s films are not sufficiently high quality when they are films themselves .
Collin named 2014 as the worst year in the year for children &apos;s films and described &quot; dragon parches easily made 2 &quot; as purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy continuation .
In films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of films is not necessarily the problem .
In July 2006 Entertainment Weekly awarded the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic evaluation for every summer film start , which takes place between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year at least 2000 volumes .
The results are based on the opinion of the cinematic visitors and film critics and suggest that this year &apos;s film hits are equivalent to those of last year .
Some commentators believe that development must be based on changing vision habits and growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix .
Director Jon Favendy , who is currently on Disney &apos;s soon released Dschungelbuch film , said to the Hollywood Reporter : &quot; I believe the times change . &quot;
We must accept this and not try to follow the past .
Unlike the current weak cash results of the Hollywood product , Netflix recently achieved sales with streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars , almost twice as much as last year , when sales was $ 837 million .
Last summer , director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios for having too much to focus on film by Comics and prophesied a &quot; core melting &quot; of Hollywood .
In light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a true core .
Due to the potential potential casino players expected in summer 2015 , including Avengers : Age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World , other representatives of the film industry are optimistic :
The manufacturer of X @-@ Men , Simon Kinberg , described the decline in the cash results recently as simply &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to Hollywood Reporters : &quot; The next summer will be the largest summer at all , and no one will worry about business . &quot;
As a few years ago , the second table tennis district was forced to open up the lift lift collection , this is a step in the right direction .
Now the German table table table has an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the program .
The result : who has not grown up is down .
For example , Gottingens has been the highest team Torpedo in the Oberliga Relegation , but it will not play in the coming season only five classic .
Four classic ones remain Torpedos ladies , despite their grandiose transit into the regional liga .
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony , as well as the boys of SC Weende .
The SG Lengern and Torpedo reserve are in the new association line to the country where the national liga are no goddinger clubs .
In the ladies , TTV Geismar plays a role in the association &apos;s association , the Torpedo branch in the national liga .
What is the composition of the composition like a better district class is now the new district class South .
Here TSV Seulingen , VfB holes , Torpedo III , Geismar , Einbeck , Hammenstedt , Bovender SV , Langenholtensen , FC Weser and TTC are on the way .
In the district liga , as regional representative Dransfeld and SC Weende , where district class of TTC II , Rot @-@ Weiß , Bovender SV II and TTV Geismar II and III . The district district of TTV Geismar II begins at least in force .
Güntersen , the TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the partie .
In the district liga start Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen .
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district liga .
The district Ligurian season of SCW boys - there is also Torpedo II - is not complete .
In a district class , Geismar , Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into season .
In the first season of the newly established regional association , the two gods start round with nine teams each .
In the West season , the red @-@ white II , Bovender SV III , Laubach II , Torpedo IV and V , MTV Grone , Dransfelder SC II , Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II .
In the East season , among other things , Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen , Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play .
Ladies and gentlemen , there are Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II , Bilshausen , Hemeln , Seulingen II , Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume .
This is still better than in the Easter ode where there are no women &apos;s teams at all .
It is clear that none of the six 2.rounding classes will achieve the desired strength , here the innovative and surrounding circle stand will have to think about it once .
Nato Summit : First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests from opponents of NATO &apos;s summit in Newport .
On Saturday hundreds of people gathered in the centre of Newport to an anti @-@ Nato march .

Government hostile protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators are from soldiers from the PTV building were pushed , said Minister Pervaiz Rashid .
The channel has been able to take the radio after a half hour .
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators who had been equipped with stomach would have damaged equipment in the editorial department .
Tote or injured were not reported .
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Heads of Government they are making of electoral fraud .
The police informed about a kilometre of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s residence , just outside the Monday , to clash with around 3000 demonstrators with security forces .
After hospital information , a police officer was injured .
At least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured during the weekend than demonstrators tried to get to Sharifs residence .
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister .
The powerful military had to take part in the army &apos;s main office on Sunday after a meeting in the army headquarters to find a political solution to the conflict , &quot; without wasting time and using violence . &quot;
Furthermore , the communication said : &apos; The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state &apos; .
The escalating violence has been concerned about intervention by the military , which has already been more frequent in the past .
The measures taken by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qadri have taken place since the independence day of 14 August .
Sharif refuses to resign .
Khan and Qadri had called their supporters on Sunday to stop .
&quot; We will not go back without Sharif being forced to resign , &quot; said Khan .
Qadri expressed similar views .
Khan raises Sharif , who was elected by fraud in May last year .
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district .
The demonstrators had initially been peaceful before Parliament until Khan and Qadri had been able to warn them of doing so at the weekend .
Housing behind two seasons of victory on place three of the table .
With 2 : 0 over size , Rapid has a bitter week on Sunday a more than half @-@ day end .
&quot; The victory is very freelance , &quot; said Trainer Zoran Barisic , whose team with the result of the European League on Thursday reached an intermediate leader .
&quot; The success was unbelievable &quot; - confirmed captain and goat steffen Hofmann who was able to work with green white on place three .
Schrammel @-@ Traumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid with the second season victory the right response to the disappointment at Helsinki and goes with a success experience in the country game break .
&quot; We wanted to show a positive response , &quot; said Foreign Defender Thomas Schrammel , who was involved with his magnificent leadership Volley from the Sixteenth minute eck in 14 minutes in 14 minutes .
&quot; I thought I had to hau the whole freshness of Thursday purely and swallow him under the smile , &quot; said the 26 @-@ year @-@ old smiling .
As a smile on 13 November 2010 for the last time in a federal ligapartie , this was still a case for Ried .
The first masterpiece in Rapid Dress will therefore give him a special reminder .
&quot; For me , this is something very special , I am from the Rapid growth , &quot; said Schrammel .
Due to short @-@ term blending of Mario Pavelic , Schrammel returned from left to right defensivside and made his thing very good there .
He has had enough experience that he has also been able to show this position .
The gate has earned itself , he has already done some assists today , &quot; praised Barisic .
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the Flanke to 2 : 0 by Hofmann after a good hour , which finally brought the decision .
For before that , guests could have written .
&quot; God was thanks today we had some luck , &quot; also noted Schrammel who was able to break performance and result in recent weeks : &quot; The results did not vote , but the game was always good compared to last year . &quot;
Barisic even found that &quot; in many games before better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team who was playing in this stadium this season . &quot;
The first three @-@ point since 26 July has therefore proved that the team structure has not been able to cover the setbacks despite incontact : &quot; Today my team has shown that it has character . &quot;
For him not least pleasantly : &apos; We finally played back to zero &apos; .
Much work during country playback also has to be done with Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several cases to complain , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger have left their start telfdebüts , making victory even more valuable .
&quot; You must not forget &quot; , &quot; Barisic , who has been in contact with Behrendt and Pavelic players over the past three days , &quot; who have been very stable in recent times . &quot;
The country &apos;s playback must therefore be used to &quot; empty and in physical areas &quot; say , &quot; Barizsic said , Barisic , who has five U21 foreign players in his ranks .
One that is probably particularly close to the break is Kapitän Hofmann .
He is a member of the team , goes through pain .
In this difficult phase , he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; noted Barisic .
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exiting in the 68th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second gate .
For the 33 @-@ year @-@ old who had his 350 Bundesliga game , it was the first hit from the game since 2 November 2013 ( 4 : 2 via Admira ) .
Hofmann : &quot; Dust not believe that everything is good now , &quot; We have certainly had a little luck , but at some point the happiness must come back to us too .
Now it was high time , &quot; said Hofmann .
He was also calling for more concentrated work : &apos; You cannot always see black and white .
We have not seen so badly in recent weeks as it was presented .
We must not believe , however , that everything is good now .
The importance of his role for the team could not be disputed .
It is a very young team that I can help very well at this moment .
We believe that this is a very important step in my own direction , &quot; said Hofmann .
Large @-@ coach Michael Baur had little to imagine and his team had little preference .
He regretted the rapid opposition &quot; from the category spell &quot; and the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute , which was created by Shiedsrichter .
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we are moving towards Tor in some phases not concrete enough .
We have too little conclusions .
Internal defense maximilian Karner saw it similar : &quot; It started just bad , but then we found it and even made a gate .
In general , more would have been done .
Under this meadow , Ruh
A powerful tribe was shown at our Councils task of the summer series &quot; My piece of Rhöner luck &quot; last Friday .
Several of these trees are still in the area of land , which is the &quot; ghost ruin &quot; above suburbs .
A wooden footpath leads to the 600 years old Eiche .
It is about the two @-@ way @-@ off of the basalt stone @-@ stone @-@ tree and basalt stone @-@ mills .
A piece below the stone wall of the Bauersberg , a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach , is located .
Vital sees the natural monument , it rains over the other trees of the surrounding area and recalls with a size of over eight metres of an American mammoth tree .
A small Buddha on a tree button indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
But despite intensive research , there were only indications of the legal system .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has added the bishop archive and invited older people from underground fountain to learn what legacy it has to do with the scourge .
The result of his investigations remained quite simply a statement for the name .
Consequently , up to 80 years ago , the goat hires should be able to protect their animals from underwater fountains from the laborious and liberated meadows .
At the foot of the building , the buildings are designed to be fully equipped with the animals that are covered by the rise .
Meanwhile , the area has regained its importance , because on the meadows , it is actually again tantamount to goat herds .
The area is also the core zone of the biosphere reserve , has cut further out .

After weeks of divers , Italy &apos;s prime minister and President @-@ in @-@ Office of the EU , Matteo Renzi , has voted against strong conservative resistance to the EU Special Summit last week to nominate his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of the EU foreign policy , you will follow the British Prime Minister Catherine Ashton .
Renzi sees how the government @-@ oriented daily newspaper La Repubblica replaces , which also calls his own team as a favorite mogherini as a strengthening of the position of social democrats and his own in the EU .
He also expects a drive for his reform package in Italy .
Last but not least , Renzi hopes that he will continue to fight against him again against him , because Mogherini will be doing so - if rather moderate - .
In contrast to the conservative representatives of President Jean @-@ Claude Juncker and the Polish President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Donald Tusk will be nominated , so that a political balance can be established in Rome .
Because the EU &apos;s chief diplomatic body will also be the deputy of the President of the Commission .
The agreement that has been reached still remains unsatisfactory .
Otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would have preferred the nomination of the 41th anniversary of the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) to be a &quot; important recognition &quot; of Italy &apos;s role in the EU .
La Repubblica spread optimism that the world &apos;s leading party offices have been well @-@ known for almost two decades and for their ambition @-@ inspired Mogherini has grown up to the &quot; enormous challenges . &quot;
The roman is a married and has two daughters .
Your party career began to be a doctorate of politology in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratic Party of Sinistra ( LinksDemokraten ) , which was involved in 2008 with the Catholic Central Party Margherita on today &apos;s Social Democratic PD .
In 1999 Mogherini was appointed Vice @-@ President of the European Community Organisation of Social Youth ( European Young Socialists ) .
With the election of 2001 in the Party Council of the Left Democrats , they increased into the high party policy , worked in the department of foreign policy , whose leader she soon became .
They occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy , such as the Middle East , was created by studies on NATO &apos;s use in Afghanistan , where Italy was involved with a force quota , known as contact with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States .
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Members who have been an expert in defence and European and international affairs .
As a Renzi in February 2014 Prime Minister , he was appointed Mogherini to his Foreign Minister .
If the PD is once again a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which has been divided into over 40 % votes in the EU elections in May , then as stated in PD circles , Federica Mogherini has a share in this .
The Commission &apos;s proposals in Brussels , the new EU external representative , have too little diplomatic experience , so commands it to substance , will be condensed in the PD .
In Brussels , especially Poland and the Baltic Members , there are unhappy realistic acts of mogherinis in the crisis in Ukraine and , as a &apos; russland @-@ friendly course &apos; , diffamates .
It supports the gas prom operating pipeline South Stream , which is based on Russian gas under the direction of Ukraine directly following the southern Europe , which also serves Italy &apos;s energy security .
After Renzi was elected President in July , he was appointed as EU President , Mogherini went to Moscow for his first visit to state .
Photos that they have taken with Putin at Shake @-@ hands have been recorded in Brussels with indignation , as well as that they have become the Kremlin &apos;s head for October to send an economic summit to the Kremlin .
In total nine young people have been training on Monday at emz @-@ Hanauer in Nabburg .
This is an Azubi which has already had another training in the company .
In four training professions , the new employees will operate : electronic engineers ( three training courses ) , Mechatroniker ( two ) , tool mechanics ( two ) and process mechanics ( two ) .
All Azubis come from the Schwandorf district : Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach , Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden , John Beer from Neunburg vorm Forest , Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach , Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz .
The new training participants visited the main or middle schools and real schools before .

The Socialists in France should keep their mouth and put France in order , &quot; said the most important ally of Francois Hollande .
Mr Valls called for the deep left to &quot; express love &quot; for the controversial socialist president , whose cabinet education is based on disapproval of the vast majority of French .
The President deserves all due respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
&quot; It is our duty to remain on its side , &quot; he said at great appearances .
As a significant gesture , the Prime Minister insisted that his government should take over the controversial 35 @-@ hour week in France despite strong demands for easing the regulation of Emmanuel Macrons , which will not question new economic ministers .
On Saturday Mr Hollande had called upon his co @-@ socialists to join &quot; united &quot; with the government .
But Christiane Taubira , the Minister of Justice , has been fighting sand into the bearings where she was abducted at a meeting of a detrusory socialist Member and criticised the Socialist Party for having taken the French &quot; faith in their future . &quot;
Marine Le Pen , who is far right @-@ wing leader of the National Front , has been able to overcome the constant clashes of Socialists and said that they cannot imagine that the new Valls government will continue for longer than a few months .
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but Prince Manuel Valls also has no obligation to form a new government if the old one has not lived over a summer .
&quot; And the new will not survive the autumn or winter , &quot; said Fräulein Le Pen to supporters .
They repeated the reputation of their party for a resolution of Parliament and said that they were confident that they would be able to win elections in advance and were ready to government .
The ruling party of France was a defeat in March and the right @-@ wing National Front was at EU elections in May .
A survey in the Sunday Journal of the Union of Dimanche showed that 76 % of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of being suspended before the end of Holland &apos;s term of office in 2017 in several rival groups .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at Sciences Po University , warned that French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and the recorporation figures 40 .
&quot; There is a small window for possibilities , but public opinion must quickly feel that things change , &quot; he warned .
Otherwise , the situation may deteriorate further .
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion $
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O , the third largest cross @-@ road provider in the world , is leading to advanced negotiations on purchasing Prestige Cruise International Inc .
A deal would lead Norway Cruise , a company with a market value of 6.8 billion dollars , access to the luxury crossroads of Prestige Cruises and its prosperous coasts , while with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd ( RCL.N ) and Carnival Corp ( CCL.N ) in competition .
An agreement could already be announced this week , said the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks could also be unsuccessful .
The owner of Prestige Cruises , who is private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC ( APO.N ) also has a share of 20 % of Norway Cruise .
The sources were to remain anonymous , since negotiations were not public .
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises replied not to requests for comments , while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment .
The hotel is located in Miami , Norway &apos;s heated company , near 13 Kreuzfahrt ships operating on routes between North America , the Mediterranean , the Baltic Sea , Central America and the Caribbean .
His revenue was $ 2.57 billion in 2013 , an increase of 13 % compared to 2012 .
Prestige Cruises , also located in Miami , operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent , which operates eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia , Russia , the Mediterranean , North America , Asia , Africa and South America .
It reported revenue for 2013 from $ 1.2 billion , an increase of 6 % compared to the previous year .
The cruise industry is around $ 29 billion and will be available for it over the next few years , owing to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India .
Companies are trying to find themselves the best choice for these new customers when they are cruising .
Prestige Cruises asked for US regulators to register in January 2014 .
Apollo is the majority shareholder of the company since an 850 million $ Deal 2007 .
Norwegian Cruise was born in its present form in 2000 by merger with a cross @-@ road supplier owned by Genting Bhd ( GENT.KL ) , a leisure and casino company under control of the Malaysian Millionaire Lim Kok Thay .
Apollo invested $ 1 billion in 2008 in Norway Cruise .
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013 .
Genting held its doors after approval by the authorities of 28 % of shares and Apollo 20 % of shares and private equity society TPG Capital LP , at the end of June , held a share of 8 % of the company &apos;s shares .
Carnival , Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norway Cruise have a common understanding of the original application document for the stock exchange of Prestige Cruises with 82 % of passenger capacity in American cruise ships .
pro @-@ Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election .
A pekingtreue group was used near the Chinese flag .
The permanent committee of the National People &apos;s Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday , which was only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017 .
All candidates must first of all support the majority support of a nomination committee , which is expected to be accompanied by pekingtretretrev members .
This decision will make it possible for opposition democrats to vote for almost impossible and led pro @-@ democracy activists to assert their threat and to &quot; Occupy Central &quot; protests to Hong Kong &apos;s financial space .
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong ; and China &apos;s leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities .
After publishing a Beijing White Paper , which was the rule of China over Hong Kong in June , democratic activists considered an official referendum on election procedures in the special administration region where hundreds of thousands of people were marched and there was a Sit @-@ in @-@ organized Sit @-@ in .
Lis Befragung is supported by the government in Hong Kong and China &apos;s liaison office in Hong Kong .
The Vice @-@ President of the Commission for Legal Affairs of the permanent committee , Zhang Rongshun and Vice @-@ President of the Office of Hong Kong and Macao of the State Council , Feng Wei , should be asked during the day .
Studential activists announced that they would be at the afternoon before the office of the leader in Hong Kong .
Britain saw a total of 150 years of colonial government in Hong Kong before the end of the 150 years .
Putin calls on Kiev to include &quot; state talks &quot; with the Ostukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports that the Ukrainian Government would not be able to take up the fighting against separatists in the East of the country and immediately start negotiations on &quot; state sovereignty . &quot;
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later stated that Putin did not mean that the most important area of the Ostukraine region will be part of Russia , but that his status towards Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian @-@ speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests .
Putin &apos;s call to negotiate with the Kiev government on an equal footing with the pro @-@ Russian insurgency , however , is one of the most important challenges he has had since the start of the round five months ago : aid for the separatists in the areas and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to take the newly proclaimed region Novorossija facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West .
In an interview with the State TV channel Eins , Putin condemned Ukraine &apos;s military campaign to reconnect the territories occupied by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk , which took place in March and April after Moscow took over Ukraine &apos;s peninsula Krim on 18 March .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently taken the territory as &quot; Novorossija &quot; or &quot; Neurussland , &quot; a term that is linked to the pre @-@ revolutionary glory of Russia &apos;s empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who have been involved in Ukraine &apos;s campaigns have been responsible for elections on 26 October and during government groups of civilian communities in the areas occupied by separatists have hoped for rapid peace talks &quot; in their illusions &quot; are caught Itar @-@ Tass .
&quot; We must start detailed discussions without just technical questions , but also about the political organisation of society and state status of South @-@ East stud in order to safeguard the interests of those living there , &quot; he said .
Peskov said that Putin &apos;s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy must be seen , which has been discussed by Kiev &apos;s leadership for months , to dispel fears in Russian @-@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk .
Only the Ukrainian Government can guarantee the eastern areas the necessary autonomy , said Peskov .
It is not a question of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , said Peskov , &quot; because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal conflict in Ukraine . &quot;
The clarification of the Kremlin &apos;s promise to correct the &quot; misinterpretation &quot; of Putin &apos;s remarks underlined Russia &apos;s leadership in dealing with separatist rebellion in the East , contrary to the direct inception of Crimea , which is the majority of 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in supporting Donezk and Luhansk regions in the Ostukraine region , because most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and ask questions from time to time before the conflict a broad majority was found in Ukraine .
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have raised on international forums would help regional governments in Ukraine to establish their own trade agreements and external relations , and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links Russia &apos;s territory with Crimea .
The measures proposed five months ago are the Black Sea Peninsula , the home port for most of Russia &apos;s navy and an important trade area and historical coastal region .
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines , factories and goats , which produce important components for the Russian military .
Ukraine &apos;s President Petro Poroshenko proposed that he should speak before the President of the European Parliament on 7 June that Ukraine should be given the right to amend the Constitution , following new elections , which would allow Ukraine &apos;s legislation to be given greater control over its finances and status of languages .
But his idea of autonomy seems to be very different from those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels whose armed forces and incarceration are accused of Moscow .
Putin &apos;s last call to Kiev to cooperate with the separatist leaders at an altitude of time followed by another advance of the rebels last week , after Russian troops and tanks were attacked by the Aegean Sea in the Ostukraine region .
The maritime communities supported by Russia have been overtaken in the handlegrounds , which , according to Ukraine &apos;s fears , was the first step towards a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region until Crimea is the control of Nowoasowsk .
That is why massive civilian and military preparations have begun to bring Mariupol , a steel linkage with 500,000 inhabitants , who are between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula .
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine , an former Soviet Republic that has been independent since 23 years .
&quot; We are just before a point where there is no return , &quot; warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine &apos;s territory .
The EU summit did not take any concrete action to impose further sanctions on Russia , which were imposed on an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis .
Ukrainians had to move away from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers were arrested last week in the DonezkkRegion to support the Belarusian separatists , said Oberst Andrij Lysenko , spokesman of Ukraine &apos;s National Security and Defence Council Reporten on Saturday in Kiev .
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were killed by Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were killed on Sunday against 10 Russian parachers who were arrested before a week ago in Ukraine .
Nacktfotoskandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make a flour for his doctors about hackers who probably had naked images of his prayers Gabi Grecko and who was who was the A @-@ Promis from Hollywood .
The film town is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hingscandal around Promis on the Internet .
The hacker responsible for this may have 60 naked photos of Lawrence , Star from &quot; the tribute of Panem &quot; and superstars , including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne , the singer Rihanna , Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst .
From Australia &apos;s actresses Teresa Palmer , Emily Browning , Yvonne Strahovski , and Grecko from Melbourne , private photos were allegedly also taken out of private photos due to an iCloud gap .
On the list are 101 samples .
The most precious thing that happened last month with Grecko was that Confidential said : &quot; It is irreversible . &quot;
All private letters and images should remain private .
It is a shame that private information has been stolen and passed on to others .
Grecko , currently in New York , said reports that a news page that the hack &quot; is shameful &quot; and that those affected felt &quot; injured .
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her former friend Scott Speedman , including two pictures in which she is above without a pool .
The Palmers film works include &quot; love is unbelievable &quot; with Liam Hemsworth .
Palmer , Chuck @-@ Star Strahovski and actor Browning from Sucker Punch were yesterday not available for comments on the stacked images .
A representative Lawrence said to TMZ : &quot; It is a disgraceful violation of privacy . &quot;
Actors Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; Repeated images from a mobile phone is nothing other than selling hehlerware . &quot;
Rein should be legally seen as the spread of stolen images .
Radler , Jogger and Wanderer were present yesterday at the 8th cycle on the Great Feldberg and have thus helped the association &quot; Help for Cretan Children . &quot;
The tour that is suitable for one torture was for the other , a light training .
In one thing , however , everyone agreed : it was fun .
Thomas Studanski will be able to have spent the night well .
For the first time in his life , the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus was present with the wheel on the Feldberg field .
For the good purpose .
The small muscle kater can easily be removed , especially since he has been involved in the Great Field Mountain for the benefit of the association &quot; Help for Cretan Children &quot; ( Frankfurt ) also personally .
A great thing .
&quot; I know now that I can - prima ! &quot;
Small pebble on the Applauskurve ?
Nee if I had once thought I would have guessed &apos; s from ...
As Thomas Studanski , who was responsible for the CDU in the Upper Town Parliament , has been a member of many of the 718 participants yesterday in the Spring tau to mountains and came the exhaustion , but happy to the plateau .
Other than that , it was easier to reach the well eleven kilometres long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg .
Norman , for example .
The very high @-@ quality Green politicians from the Kreistag - rote Dress , red bike - made a little difference at the start ( &quot; Every lot of professionals since is the goal ! &quot; ) , then pointed out on the mountain as half professional and went to 45 minutes without Atemnot &apos;s goal .
He is also the route into a rash , as Nina Kuhn , Pressesprecherin of the city Oberursel , who together with Frank Grüneisen had taken the way .
For the two triathletes , the Feldberg radar was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; Here is Charity , because we are happy to have an exit here today , &quot; so Kuhn .
On the way they had Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg .
The boy ( 12 ) was born in the morning after Oberursel to return to the height .
Frankfurt Florian Zierz had a 9 @-@ hour stay in the Sattel in the morning , &quot; made &quot; the Feldberg two times to get home with fun .
Enjoy fun also with &quot; Fritten @-@ Toni . &quot;
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks , cycling tours are easy to reach .
He had a 6.5 @-@ kilo race wheel 40 minutes .
A backward event .
For this purpose - since I am happy to say , Andreas Balzke .
The maintainer &apos;s well @-@ established statement is that he is a &quot; ambitious racing cyclist . &quot;
This must also be true , because it was with the Fixie wheel that were also racing bikes , but without circuit ...
That even without wheel locker up was not only proven by 20 Wanderer who had been over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit , but also by a jogger who was on a cordel with weights behind him .
Mountain guard doctor Professor Volker Lischke , who has equipped with his team , equipped with Allrad Bully and Quad , said : &quot; The kenn &quot; I from Frankfurt , who trained for a special Schlitten for a special Schlitten halt himself . &quot; So the man is certain to be his own hobby and .
The 718 participants - and thus many as never - were in groups on the way in the morning .
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m .
It followed the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m. .
Five minutes later , the first mountain bikers left .
Bent Hansen , Chairman of the Association &quot; Radeln auf den GroßFeldberg , &quot; announced the start commandos and wanted the participants a beautiful trip .
For next year he hopes that it will succeed in moving the route to Feldberg to the safety of participants .
